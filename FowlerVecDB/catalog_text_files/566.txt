Reputation
Chapman University is California’s third largest private university and has been ranked in the top tier of the U.S. News & World Report listing of Western comprehensive colleges and universities for the last 24 years. In student selectivity, Chapman has ranked first or second in U.S. News for the past decade, a direct tribute to the quality of our students. The University has also earned accolades from U.S. News & World Report for excellence in undergraduate teaching. Recognizing Chapman’s focus on values and ethics, the University has been listed in the highly respected Templeton Guide: Colleges That Encourage Character Development. Recognition of the quality of a Chapman education is also reflected in the fact that since 1993 we have established more than 50 endowed chairs and professorships and have received grants from the nation’s most prestigious foundations. Chapman is categorized by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education as an R2 “high research activity” institution. The media have recognized Chapman’s value as well: The Orange County Register has called Chapman “one of the hottest private schools in California,” The Washington Post lists Chapman as a “hidden gem” among U.S. universities, and Kiplinger’s names Chapman as among the best values in higher education.
Campus
Chapman University is located in the heart of Orange County, California, an exciting and ever changing nexus of technology, business and the arts. A blend of new, state of the art and historic buildings on the Chapman campus offers students the latest educational and technological resources. Among recent additions to the campus:

The Keck Center for Science and Engineering, opened in the fall of 2018, houses the science and engineering programs in the Schmid College of Science and Technology and the Fowler School of Engineering. At 140,000 square feet, it is the largest and most ambitious building in the University’s history.
The Harry and Diane Rinker Health Science Campus, located in Irvine, houses classrooms and laboratories for graduate students enrolled in the Chapman University School of Pharmacy, doctoral physical therapy program, the master of medical science physician assistant program and other graduate health science programs in the Crean College of Health and Behavioral Sciences.
Marybelle and Sebastian P. Musco Center for the Arts, an elegant 1,044 seat high tech professional arts venue that can accommodate full scale Broadway, opera, ballet and other touring productions, as well as Chapman student performances.
The Hilbert Museum of California Art, which exhibits and celebrates the unique California Scene Painting movement that flourished roughly 1920-1970, depicting important growth and change in the Golden State.

A Chapman Education
A Chapman education focuses on the intellectual, physical, social and spiritual dimensions of life. Unlike many schools of its size, Chapman emphasizes a personalized approach to education. In addition, a number of programs have received the highest level of national accreditation.
Liberal Arts
Chapman’s integrated curriculum fosters independent and critical thinking, effective communication and an international perspective in the major and across fields. These principles provide students the educational foundation they need to succeed in all their endeavors.
Professional Schools
Chapman offers professional programs in business, pharmacy, education, film and television, law, music and more. Professional programs connect the intellectual to the practical and integrate academic studies with realistic challenges.
Co-Curricular Learning
Learning outside the classroom is vital. Chapman strives to provide experiences and inspiration necessary for a balanced life-a life of giving, inner growth and self-realization. Chapman offers a rich and varied range of activities and opportunities, tailored to help students explore their interests.
Values and Ethics
One of the most distinguishing aspects of a Chapman education is the ethical emphasis that underscores all academic and student life programs. Students are challenged to think, examine their values and prepare for their future considering how the world might be a better place and how they might contribute to the world. These values and ethics are based in the distinctive denominational history of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) respecting all persons, faiths, and service to the world, and our inclusive Fish Interfaith Center, upholding the Spiritual Pillar of Chapman University.
