The George L. Argyros School of Business and Economics is dedicated to preparing its graduates for roles as innovators, leaders and value creators in the twenty-first century. The Argyros School seeks to accomplish this through academic programs blending the best of business theory with exposure to the best of business practice. As globalization and technological advancement lead to increasing complexity in business affairs, the Argyros School strives to meet the educational needs of the next generation of business leaders.
In addition to offering rigorous degree programs, the Argyros School operates centers that address the driving forces of the market: economic research, entrepreneurship, globalization and finance. In our centers, faculty from various functional disciplines work together to address interdisciplinary themes in teaching, research and outreach. The centers provide a means to take the George L. Argyros School of Business and Economics to the business world and to the larger community and conversely to bring the outside business world and community to the school. Additional information about our centers is found by clicking the title links below.
