Policies and Procedures
Chapman University provides a uniquely personalized and interdisciplinary educational experience to a diverse group of highly qualified undergraduate students by encouraging innovation, creativity and collaboration.
At Chapman, we use a holistic admissions process to evaluate how well an applicant will fit into the campus community. This means that we look at the entire student, including high school and/or college records, standardized test scores, co-curricular activities and personal character, as well as an applicant’s special interests, talents and background.
Students applying for undergraduate admission should be aware of the following application deadlines and procedures. For detailed information, view frequently asked questions for undergraduates at www.chapman.edu/admission/undergraduate/faq.aspx.
Admission Deadlines
To receive full consideration for admission and financial aid, students must submit a completed application (with all supporting documents and materials) through the Common Application at www.commonapp.org by the appropriate deadline indicated below.
Film Production has a required deadline of November 1. Dance, Pre-Pharmacy, Screen Acting and Theatre Performance candidates have a priority deadline of November 1, and students are highly encouraged to apply by this deadline. When appropriate, candidates not selected for Early Action or Early Decision admission will be rolled to the Regular Decision cycle.
Early Action and Early Decision notification takes place in mid-December. Dance, Film Production, Screen Acting and Theatre Performance release decisions on an abridged timeline with rolling notifications beginning as early as mid December for some programs. Contact the admission office for program specification. Notifications for Regular Decision will be released in mid March for first-year students and rolling notification for transfer students will begin in mid February.

Late Consideration
First-year and transfer students submitting applications after the deadlines stated above will be considered for admission and financial aid on a space and funds available basis.
Transfer Students
You are considered a transfer student if you have graduated high school (or equivalent) and enrolled at a regionally accredited college or university. Chapman welcomes fall and spring applications from students transferring in from either two or four year colleges or universities. For information and resources on transferring to Chapman, including Chapman’s transfer credit and articulation guidelines, visit the transfer students home page at www.chapman.edu/admission/undergraduate/transfer-students.aspx.
To apply as a transfer student, visit www.chapman.edu/admission/undergraduate/applynow.aspx, where you can find a full transfer student checklist that walks you through the application process. You can apply directly through the Common Application at www.commonapp.org.
Military and Veteran Students
Chapman provides assistance to active military, veterans and their dependents who may be eligible for various educational benefits. Information for applying and using these benefits may be obtained by contacting the Veterans Resource Center at va@chapman.edu. Military/VA students also must complete the VA student responsibility form at www.chapman.edu/students/academic-resources/registrar/_files/forms/v-responsibility-form.pdf after registering each semester and submit it online.
International Students
Students do not just come to Chapman from more than 80 different countries because of our location in sunny Southern California. They also come for the incredible opportunities, including international internships, undergraduate research, study abroad programs, student activities and leadership development. Visit the international student home page at www.chapman.edu/admission/undergraduate/international-students.aspx for frequently asked questions and details about applying to Chapman as a first-year or transfer international student.
International students can apply online at www.chapman.edu/admission/undergraduate/applynow.aspx, which offers international student checklists (for both first year and transfer international students) that walk you through the application process. They can also apply directly through the Common Application at www.commonapp.org.
 Standardized Test Scores
Applicants are required to take the SAT or ACT and provide scores from these tests for consideration during our admission review process.
We accept SAT/ACT score delivery via self-reported scores within the Common Application (listed within the “Testing” section), or official scores sent directly from CollegeBoard or ACT. Although official scores are not required at the time of application, they are required when making an enrollment deposit, after an offer of admission.
Chapman will superscore the SAT, but not the ACT. Superscoring is when the highest score from each section of the test is used for review, no matter if the individual scores are from one test sitting or multiple sittings.
Chapman has no preference for which test the student takes, but encourages students to list/send scores from all testing attempts. Chapman will only utilize the scores that put students in the most competitive position in our applicant pool.
 Provisional Admission
Provisionally admitted students have additional requirements and suggested resources available to promote academic success on campus. Prior to course registration, they are required to meet with their Academic Advisor to develop a four-year plan that best meets their needs. We also recommend they visit our Tutoring, Learning, and Testing Center   either in-person or via the website, to explore the resources available to aid in their academic success. Provisional admits are limited to 14 semester hours of credit during their first semester at Chapman. After completing this initial semester with a minimum of a 2.0 GPA, these credit restrictions are lifted.
Enrollment Before Admission
If you are admitted for the fall semester, you should request a registration permit for the preceding summer session from the Office of the University Registrar at www.students/academic-resources/registrar/. To be granted a permit, you may be asked for approval from the Office of Admission.
Permit to Register
For non-degree seeking students, please visit www.chapman.edu/students/academic-resources/registrar/_files/forms/permit-to-register.pdf.
Deferring Admission
Students are only accepted for the term and program specified in their letter of admission. If a student wishes to defer their admission to a different term they can submit a Chapman University Deferred Enrollment Form to the Office of Admission for approval. A student may defer their admission for up to one year of the original admission. Longer gaps will be considered at the discretion of the admission committee. Only students who have been formally admitted to Chapman University may request a deferral. Certain programs are not eligible for deferred enrollment; please refer to the Chapman University Deferred Enrollment Form for further information regarding policy and procedure.
Rescinding Admission
A student’s offer of admission is contingent upon their continued academic success throughout the remainder of the school year. The Office of Admission will require an official copy of a student’s final transcript to be sent upon completion of their work.
In addition, a student’s admission offer may be revoked if the official test score differs from their submitted unofficial test score, or if a testing board cancels their score.
Interrupted and Re-Enrollment
Students may find it necessary to interrupt progress toward their degree and return at a later date. If a student has completed their first term in a degree-seeking program and leaves the University in good academic standing or on academic probation, the student will not need to re-apply but can re-enroll for classes at Chapman by submitting the re-enrollment form to the Office of the University Registrar.
Degree-seeking students who completely withdraw from their first term due to family emergency, medical reasons, or military/occupational relocation may petition for interrupted enrollment. Veterans receiving honorable discharge and who left the university to perform military service will be re-admitted with the same academic status when the student last attended Chapman. The length of absence from Chapman for veterans cannot exceed five years. For full details on interrupted enrollment and the re-enrollment process, visit the registrar student services website at www.chapman.edu/students/academic-resources/registrar/student-services/.
Readmission
If an undergraduate student left the university in good academic standing or on academic probation and was gone for 5 consecutive semesters or more (excluding interterm and summer sessions), and has not since earned an undergraduate degree from another institution, the student must submit an Application for Re-Enrollment to the Office of the University Registrar.
The Application for Re-Enrollment must include all required official transcripts for review of re-enrollment eligibility. Official transcripts must be received in the Office of the University Registrar within 30 days of submission of the Application for Re-Enrollment. Otherwise the application will be cancelled.
If students take coursework during their absence from Chapman University, they must provide official transcripts of that work to the Office of the University Registrar. Students who have been away from the University for more than 5 years must provide official transcripts from all institutions attended. Chapman University will verify enrollments at other institutions to confirm that all official transcripts have been submitted.
Prior to applying for re-enrollment:

Review the policy for Undergraduate Re-enrollment as stated above.
Provide official transcripts from all institutions attended.
Submit the Application for Re-Enrollment Form.

Official review of the Application for Re-Enrollment will not begin until all official transcripts have been received.
Students wishing to return to Chapman University are eligible for Re-Enrollment so long as the major and/or minor meet the following criteria:

The major and/or minor are still being offered by Chapman University.
The major and/or minor have not had significant changes due to regulatory requirements.
The major and/or minor are not impacted programs calling for selective admission.

The student will enroll under the general education and major or degree requirements in effect at the time the student returns to Chapman. The Office of the University Registrar will review student program requirements and evaluations under the student’s previous catalog year. Once reviewed, and previous information and evaluation are compiled, the information will be submitted to the academic department for review. Decisions made by the academic departments or schools on catalog requirements are final.
