The University strives to develop in students the ability to think clearly, communicate effectively, explore issues from contrasting points of view, value human and cultural diversity and make informed ethical judgments in an increasingly complex world.
Highlights
Vision Statement
Chapman University will be a student-centered institution, recognized nationally and internationally as a center of academic and personal excellence that prepares our students to contribute to a global society.
Mission
The mission of Chapman University is to provide personalized education of distinction that leads to inquiring, ethical and productive lives as global citizens.
Central Commitments
The mission of Chapman University finds expression through the following central commitments:

Create stimulating learning environments for a diverse population.
Recruit and retain an outstanding faculty that cherishes teaching, research and creative activity as primary professional commitments and that strives to build a creative intellectual community in which the inquiring life is exemplified by a shared commitment among students and faculty to the pursuit of knowledge.

History
Chapman University traces its roots back more than a century and a half to Hesperian College, which opened on the same day that Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated as the sixteenth U.S. president in 1861. Hesperian and several other institutions later merged with California Christian College in Los Angeles. In 1934, the institution was renamed in recognition of its most generous benefactor, C.C. Chapman, successful real estate investor, church leader, politician and citrus grower. Chapman College moved to the city of Orange in 1954. In September of 1991, the college became Chapman University, further strengthening its commitment to international education and an innovative undergraduate curriculum and graduate programs.
Accreditation
Chapman University is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, Senior College and University Commission (985 Atlantic Avenue, Suite 100, Alameda, CA 94501, (510) 748-9001). Chapman University is also proud to have many of its programs nationally accredited through the following accreditors:

Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education
Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (provisional at time of publication)

Reputation
Chapman University is California’s third largest private university and has been ranked in the top tier of the U.S. News & World Report listing of Western comprehensive colleges and universities for the last 24 years. In student selectivity, Chapman has ranked first or second in U.S. News for the past decade, a direct tribute to the quality of our students. The University has also earned accolades from U.S. News & World Report for excellence in undergraduate teaching. Recognizing Chapman’s focus on values and ethics, the University has been listed in the highly respected Templeton Guide: Colleges That Encourage Character Development. Recognition of the quality of a Chapman education is also reflected in the fact that since 1993 we have established more than 50 endowed chairs and professorships and have received grants from the nation’s most prestigious foundations. Chapman is categorized by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education as an R2 “high research activity” institution. The media have recognized Chapman’s value as well: The Orange County Register has called Chapman “one of the hottest private schools in California,” The Washington Post lists Chapman as a “hidden gem” among U.S. universities, and Kiplinger’s names Chapman as among the best values in higher education.
Values and Ethics
One of the most distinguishing aspects of a Chapman education is the ethical emphasis that underscores all academic and student life programs. Students are challenged to think, examine their values, and prepare for their future considering how the world might be a better place and how they might contribute to the world.
For inquiry and the opportunity to learn more about Chapman’s vision of personalized education, contact the Office of Admission noted below or explore Chapman’s website at www.chapman.edu.
Diversity on Campus
Chapman supports diversity on campus through programs, initiatives, services, and committees coordinated by the Cross-Cultural Center, Civic Engagement Initiatives, Disability Services, the Interfaith Center, Promising Futures Mentorship Program, Summer Bridge Program, Residence Life and First Year Experience, the Argyros Forum Student Union, the University Program Board, student organizations, academic departments and more. During the academic year, there are a wide range of opportunities to engage in cross-cultural dialogue, experiences, and opportunities that foster a sense of identity, empathy, and community. The programs and services offered support students and seek to increase understanding and appreciation of diversity on campus and within the surrounding community. Student advocacy for diversity on campus is directed through the Student Government Association and Graduate Student Association. Faculty diversity efforts are channeled through the Faculty Diversity and Inclusion Committee. The Office of Diversity and Inclusion endeavors to bring students, staff, faculty administrators and trustees together for meaningful dialogue focused on developing strategic priorities and recommendations for diversity and inclusion at Chapman.
Graduate Education
Chapman’s graduate curricula are designed to provide advanced study in specific disciplines to broaden and deepen knowledge of the subject studied. In addition, graduate degrees give the students practical training and skills for advancement in selected professional careers.
Small classes and close personal supervision by the faculty are hallmarks of Chapman. Graduate students are expected to show persistence, maturity, the capacity for growth, and an interest far beyond the attainment of the minimum requirements for degrees.
Faculty
The more than 522 full-time (517 instructional, 5 research) and 595 part-time faculty represent an outstanding range of intellectual interests, research endeavors and creative activities. They include noted researchers in the sciences and social sciences, gifted artists, prolific writers, talented film makers and widely published and recognized scholars.
As a community, the faculty is comprised of people who connect active scholarship and creative activity with teaching and learning as a bridge between research and practice. Their research and creative work informs both their teaching and their lives in ways that enable students to see the value of a commitment to lifelong learning. Some 86 percent hold terminal degrees and 47 percent are tenured. Full-time faculty teach two to three courses a term.

Chapman University allows students to receive academic credit for both paid and unpaid internships.
Internship courses follow the same tuition and credit policies outlined in Tuition  and Interterm policies (See Expenses, Financial Information, and General Information Policies of the catalog).

A maximum of 6 credits of internship courses may be completed at the same internship site.
No internship nor practicum credit is accepted in transfer. See Transfer Credits in the Academic Policies and Procedures  section.

Internship Grades

Independent internships are graded by the student’s Faculty Internship Advisor on a Pass/No Pass  basis. Seminar internships may be subject to letter grade.
If an internship for a seminary course is not secured by the 5th week of the term per the academic calendar, the student is expected to withdraw from the course, resulting in an automatic W notation on their transcript.

Disability Services
Chapman University is committed to making its educational opportunities accessible to qualified individuals with disabilities in accordance with applicable state and federal laws. By providing access to qualified students with disabilities, the University demonstrates its belief that the community will benefit from their skills and talents. In this regard, Chapman University has implemented the following policies:

Chapman University strictly prohibits any form of discrimination on the basis of an individual’s disability.
Chapman University offers reasonable accommodations to otherwise qualified individuals.

The director of Disability Services administers these policies. Summaries and references to these policies are provided in the University’s application and admissions materials and its student handbook. Individuals can also obtain information about these policies, services, documentation requirements, etc. from Disability Services at (714) 516-4520.
Disability Services serves as the clearing house for all requested accommodations. It is the responsibility of the student requesting accommodations to make these needs known in a timely fashion and to provide proper documentation and medical evaluations as required (www.chapman.edu/disabilities). It is recommended that the student provide these materials prior to the beginning of the academic year or term so that the University may better serve the student’s needs and the student may avoid any irreversible academic consequences. Once notification has been made the University will engage in an interactive process in order to identify our obligation to provide reasonable accommodations. Services provided will be based on the individual needs of the student and may include extended test time, notetakers, etc. The granting of any accommodation will not be retroactive and cannot jeopardize the academic standards or integrity of the course.
Student Psychological Counseling Services
A range of confidential, short-term psychological counseling services is provided to students on an as-available basis. Limited psychiatric evaluations are available to students who are seen at SPCS for therapy. Referrals to other off-campus psychiatrists and therapists are available for all students. Graduate students must opt to pay a health and counseling fee at the time of registration.
Student Health Services
Physical well-being has a tremendous impact on academic performance. The goal of medical services is to provide the opportunity for academic success, while the focus is to provide students with easy access to health care and disease prevention.
Chapman University Student Health (CUSH) is staffed with nurse practitioners, nurses and physicians to promote good health and to assess and treat a variety of physical ailments that typically affect college-age students. Services include first aid treatment and triage, primary medicine, gynecological services, immunizations and health screening. Some medications are provided for a modest fee and some prescriptions are called into the students’ pharmacy of choice. When a student’s condition is beyond the scope of CUSH, the student may be referred off-campus for health care to a physician or clinic in the community.
The Chapman Student Health Center is located at 402 North Glassell Street (corner of Glassell and Sycamore), Orange, CA 92866. The phone number for the health center is (714) 997-6851. The center is available for walk-in visits Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to noon during regular terms. It is recommended that appointments be made for afternoon hours. Graduate students must opt to pay a health and counseling fee at the time of registration to use CUSH.
Library Services
The Leatherby Libraries, located on the Orange Campus, opened in the Fall term of 2004. The five-story facility serves as an intellectual and cultural heart of the campus and is designed to meet the information needs of Chapman’s students, faculty and staff.
Our innovative libraries combine the latest information technology with the personalized attention that is the hallmark of a Chapman education. It includes nine individually named libraries with distinctive collections representing disciplinary areas of the University: arts and humanities, social sciences, science and technology, education, music, film television and media arts, and business and economics. In addition, two special libraries are located on the 4th floor and are named the Frank Mt. Pleasant Library of Special Collections and Archives and the Sala and Aron Samueli Holocaust Memorial Library.

Church Relationship
Chapman’s roots are firmly grounded in its historic covenant with our founders, the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). That rich spiritual legacy lives on through Chapman’s focus on the development of the ethical, spiritual and intellectual person. A variety of religious studies courses and spiritual programming activities are offered, but not required. The dean of the chapel oversees an active interfaith program designed to meet the spiritual needs of the University’s students, faculty and staff. A full-time director of church relations strengthens the University’s covenant with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) as well as provides programs for the broader community. As of 2010, Chapman University is also recognized by the United Church of Christ as a church-related school. Honoring this connection, there is a special student ministry and scholarship program for students from Disciples and United Church of Christ backgrounds. Both the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and the United Church of Christ respect the many paths to God and strongly support Chapman’s nurturing of students, faculty and staff of all faith backgrounds, as well as those who are atheist or agnostic. (For more information about the Disciples and United Church of Christ program, go to www.chapman.edu/about/church-relations/.
Chapman University embraces four pillars of education: intellectual, social, physical, and spiritual. The dean of the chapel supports a host of religious and spiritual groups including progressive and evangelical Protestants, Roman Catholics, Latter-day Saints, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Baha’is, Shikhs, Wiccans and those exploring meditation, health and healing and intersections between religion and other intellectual disciplines. New groups may be formed to support the interests and needs of the current student body. Major religious conferences and speakers are hosted each year. (For more information, visit www.chapman.edu/about/fish-interfaith-center/.)
In addition to the chaplaincy services of the director and associate director of the church relations and the dean of the chapel, there is also a director of Jewish life and a director of Muslim life who serve their unique populations in addition to the entire campus.
The beautiful Fish Interfaith Center houses the Wallace All Faiths Chapel, Wilkinson Founders Chapel, Yoder Sanctuary, Peterson Conference Room, The Fashionables Courtyard, Dee’s Garden of the Senses, a lounge, administrative offices and a columbarium. A team of internationally known architects and artists cooperated in the design of this inspirational and award-winning sacred space, which opened in 2004.

Student Affairs Policies
Student Conduct Code
Chapman University expects that all students adhere to the policies that govern student behavior outlined in the Student Conduct Code. The University is specifically concerned when individual student and organizational behavior directly interfere with the University’s primary educational objectives and functions or the rights and safety of others. Chapman believes that the conduct process has a role in developing a sense of responsibility and accountability in students, while being life preparatory. To that end, the University uses education and counseling, in addition to formal conduct proceedings to bring about these outcomes. Every Chapman student is presumed to have sufficient maturity, intelligence and concern for the rights of others and the rights of the institution to help maintain established standards of the academic community. When a student or organization’s behavior demonstrates otherwise, the University will consider conduct proceedings as deemed necessary. For details regarding institutional policies governing student conduct or the disciplinary process, see the Chapman University Student Conduct Code or visit the Dean of Students Web page. Refer to the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students website at www.chapman.edu/students/dean-of-students/ to find the Code, required notifications and other relevant policies.
Firearms and Fireworks
The possession or use of firearms, fireworks or other explosives is prohibited on campus and may be grounds for immediate dismissal.
Freedom of Speech and Expression
Freedom of speech and expression are especially important values within an academic community. Thus, with rare exception, all topics are appropriate for discussion and debate within the framework of academic inquiry. Students and student organizations are free to examine and discuss all questions of interest to them and to express opinions publicly and privately. Students are always free to support causes by orderly means, which do not disrupt the regular and essential operation of the institution. At the same time, it is clear to the academic and the larger community that in their public expressions or demonstrations, students or student organizations speak only for themselves and not for the institution.
Grievance Procedures
Students who have concerns about campus academic policies, procedures, other policies, treatment by faculty or other campus employees or concerns about college operations are encouraged to bring those concerns or complaints to the vice provost for graduate education.
For academic matters, the process normally begins with the faculty member involved. Appeals typically go to the department chair, the academic dean, the Graduate Academic Council and then the vice provost for graduate education (who will act on the matter or refer it to the provost). For non-academic matters (issues related to departments such as residence life, facilities management, business office, etc.), students should first discuss the matter with the head of the appropriate department with appeals to the appropriate supervisor. Students wishing to discuss or report concerns about harassment should contact the vice president for student affairs.
Harassment, Discrimination and Sexual Harassment
Chapman University is committed to providing an environment which is free from any form of harassment and discrimination based upon an individual’s race, color, religion, sex, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, age, marital status, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, military or veteran status, genetic information or any other characteristic protected by applicable state or federal law, so that all members of the community are treated at all times with dignity and respect. The University is also committed to providing an environment which is free of sexual harassment in any form. It is the University’s policy, therefore, to prohibit all forms of such harassment or discrimination among University faculty, students, staff, and administrators. Independent contractors and other third parties at the University are also expected to conform their conduct to the University’s Harassment, Discrimination and Sexual Harassment Policy. The University’s ability to take action against third parties may be limited and is determined by their context of the prohibited conduct and the nature of the relationship to the parties and the University.
View a copy of the entire policy at www.chapman.edu/faculty-staff/human-resources/_files/harassment-and-discrimination-policy.pdf
The University’s administrative, faculty, staff and students are each responsible for creating and maintaining an environment conducive to work, study, and learning and for cooperating with University officials who investigate allegations of policy violations. It is the duty of every member of the faculty, staff, and administrative to assure compliance with the policy by promptly reporting allegations of the policy violations to the University’s Equal Opportunity and Diversity Officer. Students are also strongly encouraged to report any alleged violations of this policy, and may do so by reporting the Equal Opportunity and Diversity Officer.
In keeping with its policies, Chapman University not only fully complies with all local, state, and federal laws concerning harassment and discrimination, but also provided a means to assure fair treatment to any student, employee or member of the University community who believes the policy prohibiting harassment, discrimination, and sexual harassment has been violated. For further information, concerning Chapman University’s Harassment, Discrimination and Sexual Harassment Policy, please contact the University’s Equal Opportunity and Diversity Officer at (714) 997-6847.
Hazing and Disorderly Conduct
Hazing, indecent or disorderly conduct or failure to comply with the directions of Chapman officials acting in the regular performance of their duties are not compatible with the University’s function as an educational intuition and is forbidden by the Student Conduct Code. Any such behavior will result in conduct proceedings and appropriate consequences.
Local, State and Federal Laws
Students attending Chapman are subject to local, state, federal laws, and when studying outside the United States laws of foreign jurisdiction(s). Chapman reserves the right to impose institutional sanctions for violations of public laws, even when such violations occur off University property. Students may also be subject to civil and/or criminal charges for offenses on Chapman property, if such offenses are in violation of local, state or federal laws, in addition to any accountability that they may face under the Student Conduct Code or other University policies.
Rights and Privacy Act/Confidentiality of Educational Records
Chapman’s policy regarding confidentiality is in keeping with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which affords students certain rights with respect to their education records, a summary of which follows:

The right to inspect and review the student’s own education records within 45 days of the day Chapman University receives a request for access.
The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes are inaccurate.
The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student’s education records.

One exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. School officials are individuals or entities working for or on the behalf of Chapman University. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill their professional responsibility.
As allowed within FERPA guidelines, Chapman University may disclose education records without consent to officials of another school, upon request, in which a student seeks or intends to enroll.

The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failure by Chapman University to comply with the requirements of FERPA.

At its discretion, Chapman University may provide public directory information in accordance with the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Directory information is defined as information that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. Students may withhold directory information by notifying the University Registrar in writing.
A complete text of Chapman’s annual notification to students of their rights under FERPA is contained on the website of the Office of the University Registrar.
Violence
Per the Student Conduct Code, any form of violence is forbidden and may result in immediate suspension from the campus and upon appropriate determination, expulsion from Chapman University.
