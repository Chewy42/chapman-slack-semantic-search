The Schmid College of Science and Technology prepares students for the complex world of the twenty-first century by challenging them to think critically, participate in research, and engage in outreach through clubs, internships, and volunteer work. The college offers traditional and interdisciplinary degrees and programs designed for students who aspire to become tomorrow’s scientists and leaders in science and technology. The Schmid College of Science and Technology invites you to join our dynamic community of scholar-teachers, researchers, and students.
Grand Challenges Initiative
Students pursuing any B.S. degree in the college must 1) satisfy their First-Year Foundations Course (FFC) requirement by enrolling in FFC 100B - First Year Foundations: Grand Challenges in Science and Engineering ; and 2) enroll in and pass 3 (ideally consecutive) 1-credit Grand Challenges Initiative seminars.  
The Grand Challenges Initiative requirement of 3 1-credit seminar courses (SCI 150 , SCI 200  and SCI 250 ) is waived for students who have transferred in 60 or more credits from another accredited institution of higher education prior to matriculation. Dual credit (AP, IB, A-Level or college-level coursework) completed while in high school is not included; the 60 transferable credits must follow the completion of secondary school.
GPA and grade option requirements
Students pursuing any degree in the college must maintain a 2.000 grade point average in the major. All courses in the major must be taken for a letter grade except for those that may only be taken or that have a default grading option of P/NP.
Degree Program Honors
Students must have a major GPA of 3.500 or higher by the conclusion of the term prior to graduation and must have completed a minimum of 120 hours of independent research. Completion of independent research includes the completion of a scientific paper in the relevant scientific field, oral presentation to the faculty, poster presentation at the Student Scholar Symposium and a vote by the appropriate faculty group that the research, paper and presentation were of sufficient quality to merit honors. Additional degree program honor requirements, if they exist, are listed under the degree program description.
