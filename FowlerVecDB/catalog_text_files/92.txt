The Fowler School of Engineering prepares students to become leaders in constantly-evolving engineering fields that are becoming increasingly interdisciplinary and complex. Through a combination of personalized and experiential coursework, independent research opportunities, and alignment with industry partners, our degree programs produce students who are excited and fearless when it comes to solving technical problems that, at first glance, might seem impossible.
Grand Challenges Initiative
Students pursuing any B.S. degree in the school must 1) satisfy their First-Year Foundations Course (FFC) requirement by enrolling in FFC 100B - First Year Foundations: Grand Challenges in Science and Engineering ; and 2) enroll in and pass 3 (ideally consecutive) 1-credit Grand Challenges Initiative seminars.  
The Grand Challenges Initiative requirement of 3 1-credit seminar courses (SCI 150 , SCI 200  and SCI 250 ) is waived for students who have transferred in 60 or more credits from another accredited institution of higher education prior to matriculation. Dual credit (AP, IB, A-Level or college-level coursework) completed while in high school is not included; the 60 transferable credits must follow the completion of secondary school.
GPA and Grade Option Requirements
Students pursuing any degree in the school must maintain a 2.000 grade point average in the major and a 2.500 grade point average for all lower-division courses in the major. All courses in the major must be taken for a letter grade except for those that may only be taken or that have a default grading option of P/NP.
Degree Program Honors
Students must have a major GPA of 3.500 or higher by the conclusion of the term prior to graduation and must have completed a minimum of 120 hours of independent research. Completion of independent research includes the completion of a scientific paper in the relevant scientific field, or an oral presentation to the faculty, or a poster presentation at the Chapman University Student Research Day. Additionally, a vote by the appropriate faculty group that the research and corresponding artifacts were of sufficient quality to merit honors is required. Additional degree program honor requirements, if they exist, are listed under the degree program description.
Integrated Bachelor’s degree/Master of Science in Computational and Data Sciences
Students completing undergraduate engineering degrees are eligible to complete an additional year of study to obtain a M.S. in Computational and Data Sciences degree in the Schmid College of Science and Technology. Computational science is an interdisciplinary field in which computers and mathematics are used to model and simulate biological and physical processes found in the natural world. This graduate degree consists of four areas of study: bioinformatics and computational biology, analytics and applied mathematics, computational economics and earth system science. Graduate courses used to satisfy undergraduate degree requirements may also satisfy up to 12 credits of graduate coursework and may be double-counted towards both bachelor’s and master’s degrees. For specific criteria, refer to the Schmid College of Science and Technology’s section of the Graduate catalog.
