VA Pending Payment Compliance Policy
In accordance with Title 38 US Code 3679 subsection (e), this school adopts the following additional provisions for any students using U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Post 9/11 G.I. Bill® (Ch. 33) or Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment (Ch. 31) benefits, while payment to the institution is pending from the VA. This school will not:

Prevent the student’s enrollment
Assess a late penalty fee to the student
Require the student to secure alternative or additional funding (if covered 100% by VA funding)
Deny the student access to any resources (access to classes, libraries, or other institutional facilities) available to other students who have satisfied their tuition and fee bills to the institution.

However, to qualify for this provision, such students are required to:

Produce the VA Certificate of Eligibility (COE) or 1905 by the first day of class.
Complete the electronic VA Benefits Certification Form or submit a written request.
Provide additional information needed to properly certify the enrollment as described in other institutional policies.

Health Insurance
Health insurance is required for all graduate students. The deadline to enroll into the University health insurance plan is no later than the third week of each term.
Graduate students must possess health insurance in order to enroll in the student health center service fee, which includes access to Student Psychological Counseling Services.
Students can visit the Business Office website at www.chapman.edu/sbs for further information on the University student health insurance and student health center fee.
Proof of Student Health Insurance

Students are required to have health insurance. Before coming to campus or moving into Chapman housing, students must submit proof of insurance:
	
Submit proof of insurance as required by university policy.
Submit proof of immunizations as required by law or university policy.


Student health insurance plan:
	
Students may opt to enroll in a student health insurance plan provided by the university. To qualify for this option, students must be enrolled with a minimum of six credit hours. Any students who do not meet the six-hour standard will need to secure their own health insurance.



Tuition Protection Plan (optional)
The plan can guarantee a refund of monies paid to the University in the event that the student suffers a serious illness or accident and must withdraw from the University before the term is completed, but after the established withdrawal dates for tuition credit referenced in this section. This elective plan provides coverage for tuition, fees and room and board charges*. No exceptions will be made to the tuition credit (withdrawal) policy for students/parents who elect not to purchase this coverage. For further information, please review the Student Business Services Tuition Protection Plan webpage at www.chapman.edu//tuitionprotection.
*This plan must be purchased prior to the first day of the term.
Add/Drop/Withdrawal - Financial Aid
Dropping below full-time or part-time status may affect any financial aid that has been awarded and may result in a balance due to the University. Please refer to the Graduate Financial Aid Office.
Specific procedures for adding or dropping a class must be followed as specified in academic policies and procedures.
A petition to withdraw from the University or drop classes after tuition credit deadlines does not reduce the student’s financial obligation to the University.
Please note that the dates to withdraw or drop classes for tuition credit differ from those to withdraw or drop classes for academic purposes.
Whether any refund will result from the tuition credit received depends on the payments that have been made.
Failure to attend class or merely giving notice to an instructor will not be regarded as official notice of drop/add or withdrawal.
*Students choosing to remain enrolled past the last day to drop with refund are obligated to cover all tuition, fees, room and board charges incurred in accordance with the refund policy for tuition, room and board charges.
