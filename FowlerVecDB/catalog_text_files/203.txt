The Master of Science in Health and Strategic Communication graduate program aims to foster an understanding of the behavioral, psychological and social bases of health and requires students to engage in individual scholarship or team research of an interdisciplinary nature. The M.S. in Health and Strategic Communication can be completed in two years or as a one-year accelerated program.
The Ph.D. in Communication graduate program is grounded in communication theory and both quantitative and qualitative approaches to research design.
