Students who have undergraduate degrees in film or significant, documented prior experience in the film and television arts may petition to replace certain basic requirements with other graduate level film and television courses.
MFA in Film Production applicants who demonstrate advanced professional experience and/or who have completed a degree in a film major may, in exceptional cases, apply directly to the second year of the program (the beginning of conservatory program).
The Master’s Thesis/Project
The intent of the coursework in all programs is to prepare the student for a final thesis project. Students must have a cumulative GPA of 3.000 “B” to meet the minimum eligibility requirements to begin work on the thesis project and enroll in thesis credits. Students writing a thesis or producing a thesis project as part of their master’s degree will work closely with a faculty thesis supervisor. Guidelines for successful completion of the thesis process are available from the chair of the graduate programs. Students should observe the printed deadlines for submitting an application for degree conferral graduate form when the thesis project is near completion. (See the academic policies and procedures  section for additional guidelines.)
Master’s Degree Time Limit
For the Master of Fine Arts in Film Production, all coursework and thesis requirements are designed to be completed within three years of the date of the student’s catalog year entry into the program.

Students may not deviate from their assigned program curriculum (see requirements for the degree) in any semester without the consent of the chair of the graduate programs. An official leave of absence form (available from the Office of the University Registrar) must be approved in the event a student is unable to take required classes during any semester while in residence. A detailed explanation of the reasons for needing a leave of absence and a proposed timeline for completion of degree requirements will be required for approval. A leave of absence may not exceed two years.
Persons failing to notify the Dodge College of a leave of absence will be subject to:

Reapplication to the degree program and any new admission guidelines in effect at that time.
Completion of any new or additional coursework and thesis requirements in place at the time the student wishes to resume study and/or complete the thesis.

Under no circumstances will a leave of absence be granted or a student be readmitted after seven years from the date of initial enrollment.
All degree requirements, including the thesis project, must be completed within seven years.
Student Code of Conduct
The collaborative nature of the MFA conservatory programs requires cooperation and participation by every student. Students are expected to collaborate and work collegially with their faculty and peers.
