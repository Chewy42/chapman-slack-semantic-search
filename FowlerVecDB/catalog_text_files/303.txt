General Policies
Tuition Billing Information
Payment for the fall term is due no later than July 20 each year. Payment for the interterm/spring term is due no later than December 20 each year. Payment for the summer term is due not later than May 20 each year.
Monthly billing statements are available online only through Chapman eBill using my.chapman.edu.
Billing, payment and general information is also available at www.chapman.edu/sbs.
A student with an unpaid balance owed to the University or a University sponsor agency will not be given official or unofficial transcripts, diploma and will not be allowed to enroll in further classes.
Tuition Payment Options
Option 1: Tuition payment in full by term due dates (July 20 for fall, December 20 for interterm/spring and May 20 for summer).
Option 2: Payment plan enrollment per term with a $50 set up fee.
Interterm is not eligible for payment plan. For further information regarding payment options, visit www.chapman.edu/sbs.
Late Payment Fee
Payment in full is due by July 20 for Fall, December 20 for Interterm/Spring and May 20 for Summer. Late payment may result in a late fee. Please visit www.chapman.edu for further details.
Health Insurance
Health insurance is optional for all graduate students (except international and certain health science students). The deadline to enroll into the University health insurance plan is no later than the third week of each term.
For international and certain health science students, the mandatory health insurance may be waived by providing proof of health insurance coverage no later than the third week of each term.
Graduate students must possess health insurance in order to enroll in the student health center service fee.
Students can visit the Business Office website at www.chapman.edu/sbs for further information on the University student health insurance and student health center fee.
Tuition Protection Plan (optional)
The plan can guarantee a refund of monies paid to the University in the event that the student suffers a serious illness or accident and must withdraw from the University before the semester/trimester is completed, but after the established withdrawal dates for tuition credit referenced in this section. This elective plan provides coverage for tuition, fees and room and board charges*. No exceptions will be made to the tuition credit (withdrawal) policy for students/parents who elect not to purchase this coverage. For further information, please refer to www.chapman.edu.
*This plan must be purchased prior to the first day of the semester.
Add/Drop/Withdrawal - Financial Aid
Dropping below full-time or part-time status may affect any financial aid that has been awarded and may result in a balance due to the University. Please refer to the Financial Aid Office.
Specific procedures for adding or dropping a class must be followed as specified in academic policies and procedures.
A petition to withdraw from the University or drop classes after tuition credit deadlines does not reduce the student’s financial obligation to the University.
Please note that the dates to withdraw or drop classes for tuition credit differ from those to withdraw or drop classes for academic purposes.
Whether any refund will result from the tuition credit received depends on the payments that have been made.
Failure to attend class or merely giving notice to an instructor will not be regarded as official notice of drop/add or withdrawal.
*Students choosing to remain enrolled past the last day to drop with refund are obligated to cover all tuition, fees, room and board charges incurred in accordance with the refund policy for tuition, room and board charges.

Financial Aid
Chapman University offers opportunities to graduate students to apply for financial aid through Chapman University and the federal government.
Financial Aid Application Procedure

To apply for federal financial aid (loans) students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).

In addition to calling the Graduate Financial Aid Office, the federal government can be contacted for information about completing the FAFSA: (800) 4 FED AID.
Graduate Fellowship
Graduate fellowships are funded by Chapman University and are awarded by each school to entering students. The application procedures, eligibility requirements, recipients and amount of the awards are determined by the each school to which the student has been admitted. Inquiries about the program may be addressed to the office of the dean of the appropriate school.
Student Loans
Chapman University participates in the Federal Direct loan programs. In addition, there are private loans available to graduate students.
