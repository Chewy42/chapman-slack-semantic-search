General Information
Catalog
Students must meet the degree requirements of the catalog in effect the semester/term they began coursework and were admitted to that degree program. Students may opt to select a later catalog for a year in which they were enrolled. Changing to a later catalog must be officially requested through the Office of the University Registrar. Students have a one semester/term grace period to assess the changes in their new requirements during which they may return to their original catalog. After the grace period, the change in catalog year is irreversible. Other than the degree requirements, students must adhere to the academic requirements and to policies and procedures in place in the current catalog. Such requirements include, but are not limited to, course prerequisites, minimum grades for transfer work, probation and suspension requirements, etc. Statements in the catalog are for informational purposes and should not be considered as the basis for a contract between students and the University. Information regarding any changes in degree programs, graduation requirements or academic policies is made available by the appropriate academic units. For more information on policies and procedures read the graduate student handbook and your graduate program handbook.
Student Responsibility and Academic Advising
The University honors its published academic policies and programs, including required courses for graduation. The student is responsible for their program, including meeting the published requirements and deadlines. The University assists the student in making appropriate decisions by providing academic advising. However, the decisions made in the academic advising process are those of the student.
Transfer Credits and Concurrent Enrollment

A maximum of six semester credits may be transferred into graduate programs. Some degree programs limit transfers to elective credit only. Consult the appropriate program section of the catalog. Students are responsible for all material covered on comprehensive examinations as required by specific graduate degrees.
Students who wish to transfer prior coursework must petition for transfer within one semester/term after achieving regular admission.
The coursework must be taken at a regionally accredited institution.
The coursework must be graduate level or accepted in a graduate degree program. Correspondence and extension courses are not transferable.
Credit is not awarded for life or work experience.
A grade no lower than “B” (3.000) must have been earned in the course presented for transfer for all graduate degrees. Courses granted Credit (CR) or Pass (P) are not transferable.
The coursework must be relevant to the degree program.
Transfer of coursework to fulfill required courses is not advised. Please see specific programs for additional information.
Transfer coursework must have been taken within seven years of completion of the degree program.
Official transcripts must be submitted.
If the credits accepted in transfer are not the equivalent of minimum required semester credits, additional coursework must be taken to complete degree credit requirements.
After admission to a graduate program, a concurrent enrollment petition must be submitted to the academic department and approved prior to enrollment in coursework at another institution.
Requests for transfer of military coursework will be considered as fulfilling prerequisites and elective requirements only (no core courses) for those programs that accept military credit. Coursework must meet all other transfer requirements.
In the event that the content of one or more of the required courses is waived but the coursework is not accepted in transfer, the student must select a substitute with the approval of the program director or designee for additional credits.
Course credit received for graduate courses that are entirely competency-based are not transferable.
No internship nor practicum credit is accepted in transfer.

Attendance Policy
Class attendance policies are determined by each instructor and are included in the course syllabus distributed at the beginning of each term. The University recommends as a minimal policy that students who are absent 20 percent of the course should be failed. Students who do not attend the first class meeting of a course in which they are registered may be administratively dropped, unless they make arrangements with the instructor prior to the first day of class.
Address Change
Students must notify the University of any change in their addresses or phone numbers. Such changes may be made using “my.chapman.edu”, or a notification to the Office of the University Registrar from the student’s chapman.edu email address.
Degree Requirements
Admission to the Degree Program
With the exception of Doctor of Pharmacy FEAP program, admission is based upon possession of a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited institution and the fulfillment of requirements as specified for each program.
Undergraduate Prerequisites for Graduate Programs
Broad program prerequisites and specific course prerequisites are intended to improve the educational experience of the learner. The university recognizes that educational differences exist among individuals and encourages graduate students to work closely with their academic advisors to plan for personal needs and academic excellence.

Students must complete all prerequisites within the first year of graduate coursework at Chapman University. It is recommended prerequisites be completed within the first semester/term of enrollment.
Students may not enroll in any course that specifies a prerequisite unless the prerequisite has been completed.
Students may not enroll concurrently in the prerequisite for a course and the course that specifies the prerequisite (unless the Graduate Catalog permits concurrent enrollment).
A grade of “C+” or higher is required in all coursework used to fulfill prerequisites.
Prerequisite courses may be fulfilled by courses that are competency-based at the discretion of the program.

Time Limitation
All requirements for graduate degrees and credential programs, including courses accepted for transfer credit from other institutions, must be completed within a seven-year period. To request an exception to this policy a student must submit a Graduate Petition form to the Office of the University Registrar. The student’s program adviser and associate dean must submit a written statement of support for the petition. The Graduate Academic Council will review the petition and notify the student of their decision.
Continuous Enrollment
Graduate students must meet the university’s continuous enrollment criteria, as well as their program’s enrollment requirement, to be considered active students and have access to university resources.
In year-round, twelve-month programs, graduate students are required to enroll in courses every term (fall/spring/summer). In nine-month programs, graduate students must enroll in all terms required by their respective programs, which at a minimum includes fall and spring terms.
Regardless of whether the term is required by the program, graduate students who are

taking any Chapman-administered examination that is part of a degree program (e.g., qualifying or comprehensive exams),
proposing or defending a thesis or dissertation, or
having faculty members read and comment on a thesis or dissertation

must be enrolled in a minimum of one graduate credit or pay the university’s continuous enrollment fee, which is equal to one credit of graduate tuition.
If you require further information about continuous enrollment, please email the Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Education at GradEd@chapman.edu.
Leave of Absence
If, for acceptable reasons, students find it necessary to interrupt progress toward their degrees for more than one semester or trimester (interterm and summer sessions do not constitute a required term, unless the program requires attendance during these semesters or trimesters), a leave of absence may be granted. A leave permits students to retain the right to elect requirements in effect at time of the leave or to adopt those in effect at time of return. However, a Leave of Absence does not toll or place on hold the University rule that all degree requirements must be completed within 7 years from the date of matriculation to the graduate program (see Academic Policies and Procedures/ Degree Requirements/ Time Limitation); in other words, the 7-year clock continues to run even while a student is on Leave of Absence. Requests for Leave of Absence should be submitted to the Dean’s Office of the student’s college or school. (Students wishing to leave during a semester/trimester prior to the end of the withdrawal period must also officially drop all coursework, either via “my.chapman.edu” or at the Office of the University Registrar.) The Dean’s office will notify the Office of the University Registrar whether the leave application is approved. Minimum requirements for a leave of absence are as follows:

A student must be in good academic standing.
The petition must be approved by the program director and dean of the college.
The petition must state clearly and completely the reasons for the leave.
Leaves may be granted for a maximum of two years (normally one year with a possible renewal of one additional year). Failure to return after the specified time is considered withdrawal from the university. Retroactive leaves are not permitted.
A leave of absence does not supersede the policy that all requirements for a degree must be completed within a seven-year period.

Re-Enrollment
Graduate students who break enrollment for a period of greater than one semester/trimester, without receiving an approved Leave of Absence, are required to request Re-Enrollment through their program department. All students are held to the degree requirements in effect at the time of their return, unless approved for their original catalog year requirements by the program director or dean.
Further information on Leaves of Absence and Re-Enrollment can be found on the Registrar’s Interrupted Enrollment page.
If you do not plan to enroll in classes for a period of greater than one semester/trimester, please take immediate action to apply for a Leave of Absence or plan to apply for Re-Enrollment when you wish to return to taking classes. It is important to note that you have only seven years from the first date of enrollment in your program, regardless of leaves granted or breaks in enrollment, to complete your degree requirements.
Course Requirements

Credits completed for a baccalaureate degree generally cannot be accepted for graduate degree credit. (See specific policies on accelerated programs in various schools.)
Undergraduate or graduate courses completed to fulfill prerequisite requirements cannot be accepted for graduate degree credit.
Credit is not awarded for life or work experience.
All degree coursework must fulfill graduate coursework requirements; for example, graduate students enrolled in any courses in which undergraduates are enrolled must complete additional course requirements to receive graduate credit.
At least 18 credits must be in coursework at the 500-600 level for master’s degrees.
The minimum number of credits required for a master’s degree is 30. Most degrees require more. (See the individual degree programs.)
Doctoral students who transfer in credits from another university must complete at least twelve (12) credits of graduate coursework in didactic courses taken at Chapman University. These courses must be didactic in nature (e.g., independent study courses, colloquia series credits, internship or practicum credits, research credits, and thesis or dissertation credits, will not qualify).
Each student is issued a degree program in accordance with the catalog degree requirements as stated in the student’s official program evaluation in “my.chapman.edu”. No changes may be made in this program without advance approval of the program director and the dean of the college. Additional courses may not be added to degree requirements without petitioned approval by the Graduate Academic Council.

Grade and Quality Requirements
Degrees and credentials are granted on evidence of intellectual growth and development rather than solely on the basis of formal course credits. Fulfillment of the minimum course requirements set forth cannot, therefore, be regarded as the sole requisite of a degree or credential.
Residency Requirement
A minimum of 24 credits in the degree program must be completed at Chapman University for all graduate degrees. For specific program requirements, please refer to the appropriate program section. These credits do not include courses taken to fulfill prerequisite requirements. Students in credential programs are required to complete a minimum of two-thirds of the program at Chapman.
Minimum Course Grade Requirement
Unless stated otherwise by the academic program, no grade below 2.300 “C+” is acceptable toward a graduate degree or credential, but is included in calculating the overall grade-point average. Please refer to appropriate program section. By action of the Graduate Academic Council, all courses must be taken for a letter grade unless specifically noted otherwise in the course description.
Grade-Point Average
The following are University guidelines; some programs specify different GPA requirements. Please refer to appropriate program section.

A grade-point average of 3.000 based on all coursework taken at Chapman and applicable to the graduate degree or credential is required, excluding prerequisites.
A cumulative grade-point average of 3.000 based on all coursework applicable to the graduate degree or credential is required, excluding prerequisite courses.

Change of Program Policies

Students wishing to add or change their program of study must submit a completed Graduate Change of Program form to the Office of the University Registrar.
To be eligible for a change of program, students must have a cumulative 3.000 grade-point average, no grade below a “C+” in Chapman University graduate coursework, and approval of the department requested for change or addition.

Students requesting a change of program are required to follow all readmission policies and procedures, as indicated in the Graduate Catalog, prior to completing coursework for that program.
Second Master’s Degree
The following regulations govern the earning of a second master’s degree from Chapman University:

The second master’s degree may be awarded only in a distinctly different area, e.g., the student would not be awarded two master’s degrees in education in differing areas of emphasis.
The student must meet all specific requirements for the second master’s degree not already satisfied by the first.
The student may not use more than 12 credits of the first master’s degree to satisfy the requirements for a second master’s degree at Chapman.
In addition, a minimum of 24 non-duplicated credits must be taken for the second master’s degree.

Second Emphasis Area
Students completing a second emphasis area within one master’s degree program may not use previously completed coursework for one emphasis to fulfill the requirements of a second emphasis.
If a comprehensive examination is required for the second emphasis area, the student will be required to complete the examination for each emphasis.
Advancement to Candidacy
Advancement to candidacy is required for some degree programs. Please consult the appropriate program section of the catalog for specific requirements. It is the responsibility of the student to submit an application for Advancement to Candidacy to the program’s department office and a copy to the Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Education.
Comprehensive Examination
Specific degree programs require degree candidates to pass a comprehensive examination as part of the degree requirements.

This examination requires the ability to coherently and analytically to integrate knowledge gained from coursework and to relate it cogently to different situations or applications. Successful completion of coursework alone does not assure the candidate of passing the comprehensive examination.
Unless stated otherwise by the academic program, students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.000 or other GPA as determined by the program and meet all other specific grade in course requirements to meet the minimum eligibility requirements to take the comprehensive examination. Each program has specific eligibility requirements that must be fulfilled prior to the date of the examination. Please consult the appropriate section of the catalog.
An application form must be submitted by the student to the academic department to take or repeat a comprehensive examination. In addition, if the examination is not taken on the date for which the student applied, a new application must be submitted. Applications must be received by the student’s academic department on or before the posted deadline date. Deadline dates are in the University academic calendar.
Students may, at the discretion of the graduate program, have up to three opportunities (only after an interval of not less than three months, subject to additional conditions the degree program may impose) to take the examination within the seven-year period in which all degree requirements must be completed. After the second failure, examination preparation requirements are to be specified, such as auditing or repeating coursework.
Students must have passed the comprehensive examination to be eligible to participate in the commencement ceremonies.
Students who must choose either a comprehensive examination or thesis option may not switch to a different option once begun.

The Thesis/Dissertation or Project
The thesis/dissertation or project is a requirement of many degree programs.
Students writing a thesis/dissertation or project as part of their master’s or doctoral degree will work closely with their faculty adviser, who is a member of the student’s a review committee. Programs that offer a thesis/dissertation option require an oral defense of the thesis/dissertation with the review committee. Please observe the printed deadlines for submitting an Application for Degree Conferral when your thesis/dissertation or project is near completion. An electronic copy of the thesis/dissertation must be submitted to the library. A final grade for the thesis/dissertation course will not be issued until after electronic submission of the thesis/dissertation to the library.

Students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.000 to meet the minimum eligibility requirements to enroll in the thesis/dissertation or project option.
A thesis/dissertation/project defense/critique/oral examination is required. Official notification attesting to the satisfactory completion of the thesis/dissertation/project requirement, including the defense/critique/oral examination, must be provided to the Office of the University Registrar.
Students must have completed all the thesis/dissertation or project requirements, including the defense/critique oral examination, to be allowed to participate in commencement ceremonies.
Students with comprehensive examination or thesis/dissertation options may not switch to a different option once begun.

Thesis/Dissertation Committee Structure
Number of Members

Each committee shall be composed of a minimum of three members.
Under extenuating circumstances (e.g., member’s death or sudden leave), to be noted by the graduate program coordinator in a letter to the vice provost for graduate education, a student in the final stages of the thesis/dissertation may retain the existing committee without adding a member to substitute for the committee member who is no longer serving on the committee.
A fourth and/or fifth member may be added to the committee when deemed appropriate/necessary.

Committee Membership

At least two of the required committee members, including the chair, shall be members of the graduate faculty group of the student’s degree program. Only members of this group are allowed to chair a thesis/dissertation.
An individual who possesses requisite expertise, but who is not a member of the graduate faculty group in the student’s program, may serve as a third reader on a thesis/dissertation committee with the approval of the department chair. This may include part-time and adjunct faculty, retired program faculty, faculty from other programs or universities and community professionals.
Each graduate program may establish additional procedures for the appointment of thesis/dissertation committee members. These procedures should be published and made available to graduate students and the Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Education.

Thesis/Dissertation Committee Responsibilities
The Committee

The initial responsibility of the committee is to meet and determine the feasibility of the topic and the thesis/dissertation plan or proposal, and to permit the student to proceed only after such determination has been made. The committee shall sign off on the student’s plan or proposal and a copy should be kept in the student’s file in the department and sent to the Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Education. The signing of this document signifies that the student has permission to proceed with the study as outlined in the plan.
The committee shall review and approve the methodology and any instrument or questionnaire used in data collection.
The committee shall examine the student’s work and to meet and make a final determination of the acceptability of the thesis/dissertation, and to arrange for any oral defense of the thesis or dissertation in accordance with written department policies.

The Chair

The student and the committee chair, insofar as it is possible, should arrive at an agreement on an approximate time schedule, including meetings of the committee, for the accomplishment of thesis/dissertation-related work for each semester or term that the student is engaged in such work.
The chair shall have primary responsibility for the supervision of the student’s work, setting deadlines, and guiding the student’s progress.
The chair shall assume the role of “principal investigator” when the student’s research involves human or animal subjects, and shall ensure that University policies in this area are carefully observed.

Committee Vacancies and Replacements

If any committee members anticipate an extended but temporary absence during the time students are working on the thesis/dissertation, the member should arrange for means of communicating during this leave.
Any change in committee chair or membership must be approved by the graduate program coordinator and department chair.

Disputes

In the event that a dispute or disagreement arises between a student and a member of the committee or between members of the committee, the committee chair shall call a meeting of the committee and the student for the purpose of resolving the problem.
If the dispute cannot be resolved through this process, or if the proposed solution is unacceptable to the student or one of the committee members, the disagreeing party or the department chair may request that the dean of the college of school review the problem and recommend a solution.
If the problem cannot be resolved at the department or college/school level, the dispute should be appealed to the vice provost for graduate education, which will be the final level of appeal.

Termination of the Committee
In the event a student does not register for thesis/dissertation or fails to maintain continuous enrollment an active status within one semester or trimester after official acceptance by a thesis/dissertation committee, the committee chair has the option of dissolving the committee, in which case a new committee must be secured and approved before registration can be authorized.
Formatting, Transmittal and Archiving of Theses and Dissertations
Dissertations and theses completed in partial fulfillment for an advanced degree will be made available in electronic format through Chapman University Digital Commons and/or Proquest Dissertations and Theses Global.

Registration and Course Information
Course Load
A full course load for graduate and credential students is defined as nine credits per regular term, as well as summer term. A full academic load for interterm is three credits; students may take up to a maximum of four credits in interterm.
Course Numbering System
Courses are numbered as follows:
001-099 Remedial courses and courses not appropriate for college degree credit but designed to meet specific needs of individuals or groups where degree credit is not required. Remedial courses are noncredit courses.
100-299 Lower-division courses of first-year student and sophomore level; first-year student level 100-199 and sophomore level 200-299.
129, 229, 329, 429 These numbers indicate experimental coursework offered by a department. Experimental courses are designed to offer additional opportunities to explore areas and subjects of special interest and may be repeated for credit if course content is different. Course titles, prerequisites and credits may vary. Some courses require student lab fees. Specific course details will be listed in the course schedule.
194, 394 These numbers indicate coursework offered through the Chapman Study Abroad program. Courses have been approved for credit but do not equate to any regular Chapman courses.
199, 299, 399, 499 Individual study courses.
290, 490 Internship courses. No retroactive internship credit may be awarded for hours worked without timely registration in an internship course.
291, 491 Student-faculty research and creative activity courses.
300-399 Upper-division courses of junior and senior level that do not yield graduate credit. Sophomores may enroll provided they meet prerequisites and restrictions. Freshmen are admitted with written consent of instructor and chair of department offering the course.
400-499 Upper-division courses of junior and senior level that yield graduate credit for graduate students. First-year students may not enroll.
500-699 Graduate courses for graduate students and seniors meeting specific guidelines.
698, 798 Thesis and dissertation.
700-799 Post-master’s and doctoral courses.
Add/Drop
During official registration dates, students may initially register for courses, add courses or drop courses via “my.chapman.edu” in accordance with their priority registration access. Being placed by an instructor on the class roster does not constitute being officially registered for the course. Students can officially register only through “my.chapman.edu” or at the Office of the University Registrar. After the semester/term add deadline, students may not attend courses without being officially enrolled in the course.
Students adding a course after the first week of the term must get the instructor’s approval signature in order to register for the course.
If a course is dropped during the first two weeks of the semester (see academic calendar for corresponding dates for summer and interterm), no record of the course is posted to the student’s transcript. Students who officially withdraw from a course between the third and the tenth week of standard semesters will receive a non-punitive notation of “W” on their transcripts indicating the withdrawal. Students cannot withdraw from a course beyond the tenth week of the semester. It is the student’s responsibility to withdraw officially from a course or all courses. Failure to attend a course does not constitute a withdrawal. Students who stop attending courses without officially withdrawing will receive a grade of “FW,” failure to withdraw, which is calculated the same as an “F” grade for the grade-point average.
If a semester/trimester course is dropped by the last day to drop without a record of enrollment (typically occurs at the end of the second week of semester/trimester classes; see Academic Calendar for all terms and dates), no record of the course is posted to the student’s transcript. Students who officially withdraw between this date and the last day to withdraw (typically between the third and tenth weeks of semester/trimester courses; see Academic Calendar) receive a non-punitive notation of “W” on their transcripts indicating the withdrawal. Students cannot withdraw from a course after the last day to withdraw noted on the Academic Calendar. It is the student’s responsibility to withdraw officially from a course or all courses. Failure to attend a course does not constitute a withdrawal. Students who stop attending courses without officially withdrawing will receive a grade of “FW,” failure to withdraw, which is calculated the same as an “F” grade for the grade-point average.
If a course is dropped during the first week of a 7 1/2 week session (see academic calendar for corresponding dates), no record of the course is posted to the student’s transcript. Students who officially withdraw from a course between the second and the fifth week of the session will receive a non-punitive notation of “W” on their transcripts indicating the withdrawal. Students cannot withdraw from a course beyond the fifth week of the session. It is the student’s responsibility to withdraw officially from a course or all courses. Failure to attend a course does not constitute a withdrawal. Students who stop attending courses without officially withdrawing will receive a grade of “FW,” failure to withdraw, which is calculated the same as an “F” grade for the grade-point average.
Complete Withdrawal
Students must withdraw officially from coursework, either through “my.chapman.edu” or the Office of the University Registrar, before the end of the tenth week of a standard semester. (See academic calendar for deadline dates.) Students who stop attending courses without officially withdrawing will receive a grade of “FW,” failure to withdraw, which is calculated as an “F” grade. Students who drop all courses and discontinue studies during the semester/term must also notify the dean and either request a leave of absence or officially withdraw from the program.
Administrative Drop
Students who do not attend the first class meeting of a course in which they are registered may be administratively dropped, unless they make arrangements with the instructor prior to the first day of class. Students who do not attend the first two weeks of class will be administratively dropped from the course if identified by the instructor as not having attended. Students should contact the instructor if a possible error has been made regarding an administrative drop.
Pass/No Pass
By action of the Graduate Academic Council, all graduate work must be taken for a letter grade. Any exceptions to this policy will be noted in the course description of the specific course.
After initial registration in a course, in order to change the grading basis (e.g., to “P/NP”) students must submit a Graduate Petition form to the Office of the University Registrar requesting the change. The deadline for changing a course’s grading basis is the end of the fifth week for fall and spring semesters. (See academic calendar for corresponding dates for interterm and summer terms.) Once a course is graded, students cannot request a change in grading option. Certain courses require letter grades only and certain courses allow only Pass/No Pass as the grading option. Courses that allow only Pass/No Pass are noted in the course descriptions.
A student who satisfactorily completes a “P/NP” course will receive a “P” grade. Credit will be granted. However, no grade points are assigned and the grade is not computed in the grade-point average. “P” grades are equivalent to a “C+” grade or higher.
A grade of “NP” (no pass) will be given when the requirements for credit in the course have not been satisfied at the level of “C+” or higher. “NP” grades are given for “C” and below. No credit is granted, no grade points are assigned and the “NP” is not computed in the grade-point average.
Students who take a course Pass/No Pass, cease attending part way through the semester and fail to officially withdraw from the course will receive a “NP” grade.
Incomplete Grades
The grade of Incomplete may be assigned by an instructor if a student, through circumstances beyond their control, has not completed a small portion of a course by the conclusion of the term. The student must request the grade of Incomplete and must propose a date acceptable to the faculty member by which the missing work will be completed. A grade of Incomplete may not be assigned to give a student a chance to do more work to improve a grade. A grade of Incomplete may also be assigned by an instructor if academic integrity is in question at the time grades are due and the instructor requires more time to resolve the issue.
The deadline for removal of an Incomplete is one year from the first day of the term in which the Incomplete was recorded, unless a shorter period of time is specified by the instructor. In certain circumstances where the student must attend the class to fulfill the remaining requirements and when the course is not offered every semester/trimester, at the instructor’s discretion, the deadline for removal of the Incomplete will be one year from the end of the term in which the Incomplete was recorded. The deadline determined by the faculty member must be specified at the time of original submission of the incomplete grade. When issuing an Incomplete grade, instructors may issue the grade the student would have earned by assessing scores on all graded requirements. This grade is determined by including all zero points for all missing assignments in the calculation of the final grade. If the agreed upon remaining coursework is not completed in the period allotted, the assessed grade will become the grade of record.
If the instructor determines that the student would receive an “F” grade based upon the zero point calculation, then an “I” grade is entered as the final grade, with zero credit given and zero points calculated. “I” grades will become “F” or “NP” if the agreed upon coursework is not completed in the period allotted.

Students dropping a course in the prescribed manner after the add-drop period and on or before the final day to withdraw from a course (as stated in the academic calendar section) will receive a non-punitive “W” notation.
The “FW” grade is assigned to students who cease attending part way through the semester/trimester but who do not officially withdraw via “my.chapman.edu” or the Office of the University Registrar. “FW” is computed in the grade-point average as an “F.” Students who take a course Pass/No Pass, cease attending part way through the semester/trimester and fail to withdraw officially will receive the “NP” grade.
Note: By action of the Graduate Academic Council, all graduate work must be taken for a letter grade. Any exceptions to this policy will be noted in the course description of the specific course.
Grade Points
Grade points are awarded as follows: A = 4, A- = 3.7, B+ = 3.3, B = 3.0, B- = 2.7, C+ = 2.3, C = 2.0*, C- = 1.7*
*Grades of this level and below are considered unacceptable work for graduate students.
Courses Repeated for Higher Grades
Except as specified by department or school, any graduate-level course at Chapman may be repeated to improve the grade, but no more than two graduate courses may be repeated once or one graduate course may be repeated twice. The lower grade remains on the record with a notation that the course has been repeated. Only the higher grade and credit are computed in the GPA. Other than possible exceptions related to academic integrity violations, only the higher grade and credit are computed in the grade-point average. It is recommended that a course be repeated as soon as possible if it is to be taken for a higher grade. In exercising this option, a graduate student must repeat the course at Chapman University.
Course Audit
No credit is earned from audited classes. A notation of “AU” is assigned to audited classes and is not used in computing the GPA. Course requisites are enforced in the determination of registration eligibility for the course. Audit fees will be assessed. It is strongly recommended that students confer with their advisors prior to officially auditing a course.
No preregistration is allowed for courses taken as audit. Students must use the official registration form and obtain the instructor’s signature to register for a course as audit; the deadline for such a transaction is the same as the add/drop deadline for regular courses for all terms. Course requirements such as homework, exams and papers are not graded by the instructor for students who are auditing a course.
Not all courses are eligible to be audited.
Accelerated Undergraduate/Graduate Programs
An accelerated program combines both undergraduate and graduate education by allowing the undergraduate student to be conditionally admitted into the graduate program while still completing all undergraduate degree requirements. An accelerated program has a curriculum mapped across both degree programs. Typically, accelerated programs allow for the successful completion of the undergraduate and graduate degrees via a combination of undergraduate and graduate coursework.
Chapman students must apply to a graduate program in their junior or senior year. Students applying to the Master of Arts in Curriculum and Instruction accelerated program may apply in their sophomore year. Students will receive conditional admission to the program, pending completion of their bachelor’s degree as stipulated in the graduate catalog. (See explanations of conditional admission in the graduate catalog.) The minimum amount of credits required for any accelerated bachelor’s/master’s program is 148 total credits. If accepted into an accelerated graduate program where the graduate program is one year (e.g., a “4 + 1” structure) students may include up to 12 credits of approved graduate-level coursework once a minimum of 90 undergraduate credits have been completed or will be completed prior to start of the course in order to enroll in a graduate course. If accepted into an accelerated graduate program where the graduate program is two years (e.g., a “3 + 2” structure), students may include up to 24 credits of approved graduate-level coursework once a minimum of 90 undergraduate credits have been completed or will be completed prior to start of the course in order to enroll in a graduate course. Graduate courses shared with undergraduate degree requirements will only appear on the undergraduate transcript. Students would complete the remaining credit hours of graduate coursework beginning in the semester after receiving the undergraduate degree. The application process, prerequisites, GPA and graduate program requirements are as specified for the graduate program.
Individually Directed Courses
Individually directed courses cannot be audited.
Reading and Conference Courses
Reading and conference courses are offered only when absolutely necessary and when the course is not scheduled. The courses are not offered to resolve scheduling conflicts with other classes or work or to complete a schedule.
To enroll in reading and conference courses, students must complete a reading and conference form (available online and from the Office of the University Registrar) and obtain the signatures of the department chair of the course and course instructor. After receiving approval, the student must submit the form to the Office of the University Registrar. A minimum of five hours of instruction for each credit is required for reading and conference courses.
Individual Study and Research
Individual study and research is offered to students to research particular topics that are not provided for by regular curriculum offerings.
To enroll in individual study and research, students must complete the individual study and research form (available from the Office of the University Registrar) and obtain the signatures of the department chair of the course and course instructor. After receiving approval, the student must submit the form to the Office of the University Registrar. Students should spend 40 to 50 hours in instruction and research for each credit of individual study.
Probation and Dismissal

University policy is that no grade below “C+” is acceptable toward a degree or credential but is included in calculating the overall grade-point average.
A student who has completed at least six credits of coursework, whose Chapman semester/trimester grade-point average or overall cumulative grade-point average falls below a 3.000 will be placed on academic probation.
A student who is placed on academic probation must demonstrate reasonable progress in improving their cumulative grade-point average to continue enrollment after one semester/trimester on probation.
A student whose Chapman grade-point average or overall cumulative grade-point average falls below a 2.300 will be dismissed.
A student on academic probation who does not achieve a semester/trimester grade-point average of 3.000 or higher in the first semester/trimester after being placed on probation will be dismissed.
A student who is placed on probation and does not achieve a Chapman grade-point average or overall cumulative grade-point average of 3.000 within two semesters/trimester will be dismissed.
A student who is placed on probation and does not fulfill the conditions of probation will be dismissed.
The action of academic dismissal will be noted permanently on the official transcript.
A student who has been dismissed may not continue in coursework (will be administratively withdrawn) until an appeal is submitted to the Graduate Academic Council via the Office of the University Registrar. No appeals will be considered if they are not received within 10 working days of the notification date.
Students have a right to appeal dismissal decisions, to submit evidence and to have that evidence considered alongside evidence submitted by the proponent of the decision. Students who wish to appeal an academic dismissal must demonstrate both extraordinary circumstances explaining the unsatisfactory academic performance and a likelihood of success if allowed to continue at Chapman.
If the dismissal is upheld by the Graduate Academic Council, the student may appeal to the Office of the Provost, per the appeal process noted below.
If the dismissal appeal is denied by the Office of the Provost, the student will be administratively withdrawn effective immediately. The decision of the Office of the Provost on dismissal appeals is final and there is no additional process of appeal.

Petition and Appeal Process
Academic Petitions
Chapman University is sensitive to the educational advantages of a flexible curriculum, but is also conscious of a responsibility to ensure equity for all students. Permission to deviate from published regulations is neither automatic nor done as a formality; each request is considered on its own merits and in light of the petitioner’s complete academic record. Internal guidelines have been established to help committee members with their deliberation on individual cases.
The Graduate Academic Council is responsible for creating academic policies and procedures within the University. A student’s petition to deviate from general University policies is submitted to the Graduate Academic Council via the Office of the University Registrar. The Graduate Petition form is available online at the Office of the University Registrar’s website. Petitions are reviewed by the Graduate Academic Council as follows:

Challenge of a grade in a course.
Limitation/acceptance of credit.
Other degree related issues.
Other miscellaneous petitions.

The Graduate Academic Council does not consider student petitions pertaining to: (1) the adding or dropping of courses after enrollment deadlines, (2) changing the grading option after the specified deadline, (3) credit overloads, (4) late withdrawal from courses, or (5) leave of absence. Instead, such petitions will be handled at the college level by the dean or their designated representative (e.g., associate dean) and/or faculty committee.
The following policies may not be petitioned by students:

A student may not petition to have the non-punitive W mark for a late withdrawal removed from their transcript.

It is incumbent upon the student to provide all relevant evidence and supporting documentation to support the petition. The decisions on petitions made by the Graduate Academic Council are recorded within the student’s record; students are notified via the student’s Chapman email account. Please note that a fee may be assessed for certain petition types.


Academic Appeal
Each student has the right of academic appeal, the right to submit evidence, and the right to have that evidence considered. The person, committee or body considering the appeal (at each stage of the appeal process) is to consider the student’s evidence alongside any evidence submitted by the other interested parties and is to notify the student, in writing, of its decision and the basis for its decision.
For academic matters, the process normally begins with the faculty member involved, if appropriate. Subsequent academic appeals that were denied by the initial appeal to the faculty member involved go to the department or program and then to the Graduate Academic Council unless another review body is specified by the college/ school and contained in the graduate program’s handbook or manual.
Academic Appeal Process
Students may appeal a decision of the Graduate Academic Council or college/school review body to the Vice Provost for Graduate Education by providing documented evidence demonstrating one or both of the following grounds for appeal:

Procedural error made by the presiding council.
Additional evidence not available at the time of the prior hearing/decision that could serve as cause for further review.

Students who wish to appeal a decision must submit a written appeal within 10 working days of the date they are notified of the decision. The written appeal is submitted to the Vice Provost for Graduate Education at GradEd@chapman.edu and must include the following:

A signed cover statement presenting the reasons for the appeal with specific reference to one or both of the grounds for appeal described above. Submissions without grounds for appeal will be returned without review.
Documentation, including a copy of the original petition and all materials submitted to the presiding council.
A copy of the written decision of the presiding council.

Students will be notified of the decision of the Vice Provost in writing. The decision of the Vice Provost on the student academic appeals is final and there is no additional process of appeal.
Non-Academic Appeals
For nonacademic matters, students should first discuss the matter with the head of the appropriate department (facilities management, business office, etc.) with appeals to the appropriate supervisor. For matters concerning disabled student services, students should contact the director of the Office of Disability Services at (714) 744-7971.
Grade Review Policy
Professors, as experts in their fields, have the final authority in assigning student grades, except for cases involving clear evidence of capricious grading or failure to follow the professional standards of the discipline.
Faculty members may change final grades after submission to the Office of the University Registrar only for clerical error. Furthermore, additional work may not be assigned to enable the student to receive a higher grade.
However, a student who believes that he or she has received a grade based on capricious or unprofessional grading may appeal personally to the instructor for an explanation of the grade and for possible reconsideration. Students have a right to submit evidence in conjunction with the appeal, and the instructor is to consider all evidence submitted. As a professional scholar and educator, the instructor should be able to explain the grading criteria, how the criteria meet the standards of the discipline and how the individual student’s grade derives from these criteria.
If, after consulting with the instructor, the grade dispute is not resolved or if the student has made a good faith effort to contact the instructor and has received no response, the student has a right to appeal directly to the department chair of the academic unit in which the course was offered (or the associate dean if there is no department chair).
All grade appeals must be filed in writing within 30 days from the date that the grade was assigned. Students have a right to submit evidence in conjunction with the appeal, and interested parties, including the grading instructor, shall also submit any evidence, all of which will be reviewed and considered in the appeal. The department chair may deny the student petition, confer directly with the instructor of record in the course to resolve the dispute, form a faculty committee to review the grade or refer the petition to the dean’s office of the school or college of the department. The student shall be notified in writing of the decision and the basis for the decision.
If the grade dispute is decided unfavorably for the student at the departmental level, the student has a right to further appeal the decision directly to the dean’s office, to submit evidence and to have that evidence considered alongside any evidence submitted by the instructor. The dean’s office will make the final college-level decision on the petition and notify the student, in writing, of the decision and the basis for the decision. (If the student’s initial appeal was to the associate dean (because there is no department chair), the student may not bring a subsequent appeal to the office of the dean. Rather, the decision of the associate dean will be final.)
After the dean’s office notifies the student of its decision, the student has two weeks to request a review by the Graduate Academic Council. Such a request may be made only if compelling new evidence appears or if there is substantive evidence that the petition process was not followed in accordance with the grade challenge policy. The Graduate Academic Council will consider all evidence submitted (by the student and other interested parties) and render a final decision. There is no additional process of appeal.
Graduation Policies
Student Responsibility
It is the responsibility of each graduating student to refer to their program evaluation in “my.chapman.edu” to check which requirements have been completed and which requirements still need to be completed. A student may not shift this responsibility to an adviser or to the staff of the Office of the University Registrar.
Application for Degree Conferral
Although a student may have completed all requirements, degree conferral is not automatic. Every degree candidate is required to submit the online Application for Degree Conferral with the Office of the University Registrar. If the student should fail to complete requirements by the intended graduation date, the student must immediately request a future graduation date by emailing conferral@chapman.edu via their Chapman email account. If a student fails to complete requirements and has not requested the application be moved to a future date, the application shall become void and the student must refile when anticipating degree completion.
Submission of the application is done online via “my.chapman.edu.” For information and application deadlines, refer to the Chapman University website. Chapman confers degrees three times during the academic year, refer to the academic calendar for conferral dates. All degree requirements must be completed by the last day of the month in which the degree is to be conferred.
Applicants for degree conferral must plan to complete their program requirements by the end of the semester/trimester for which they applied. All degree requirements must be completed and received at the Registrar’s Office by the last day of the month in which the degree is to be conferred. If degree requirements cannot be completed, a new application for a subsequent semester/trimester must be submitted, along with applicable fees and deadlines. It is recommended students chose the next available conferral date after all degree requirements are met; students may no delay degree conferral to later terms once their program requirements have been completed. Doctoral and Masters degree requirements must be completed within a seven-year period.
Commencement
Formal University commencement ceremonies are held annually in May. To participate in the ceremonies, students must submit an online participation form. To be eligible at the time of the participation form deadline, students must have filed the Application for Degree Conferral and the student’s official program evaluation must indicate that the student is on course to complete all degree requirements satisfactorily (including comprehensive examination or defense of thesis/dissertation) by the commencement date. Students receiving degrees in January or at the end of the summer are entitled to participate in the following May commencement ceremonies.
The James L. Doti Outstanding Graduate Student Award
The James L. Doti Outstanding Graduate Student Award is awarded annually and is the highest honor for graduate students at Chapman University. Two Doti awards, one for a master’s degree student and one for a Ph.D. student, are granted. The original Doti award trophy, incorporating artist Nick Hernandez’s sculpture Emergence, remains on perpetual exhibit in Argyros Forum. Upon the trophy is engraved the names of all Doti Award recipients since 2013. The recipients must exhibit academic excellence and outstanding professional leadership during their graduate school matriculation at Chapman University.
Release of Transcripts and Diplomas
No transcripts or diplomas are released to any student who (1) has an unpaid balance to Chapman University or to any Chapman sponsored agency or (2) who has not completed the required Financial Aid exit interview.
Diplomas are mailed out approximately three weeks after the date of conferral of the degree. Under no circumstances will a diploma be released prior to the conferral date.
Unless otherwise allowed by Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations, all official transcripts are issued only with written permission of the student. Information on requesting official transcripts is available at www.chapman.edu/transcript. Unofficial transcripts are available only via “my.chapman.edu”.
Faculty Rights and Procedures Regarding Student Classroom Behavior
Faculty members are responsible for ensuring an effective learning environment for all students in their classes, which encourages active student participation, including the right to raise questions and challenge information. Hence, faculty members also have the responsibility and authority to maintain appropriate student behavior. Classes are defined as including laboratories, internships, field placements or any settings that can be designated as a learning environment, such as travel studies and field trips.
Consequently, if a student is considered to be threatening or disruptive in the classroom, and/or behaves in a way that interferes with the learning of other students or refuses to fulfill the academic requirements of the course, the faculty member has the right to have the student who demonstrates such behavior removed from the class, either by administrative withdrawal or by making arrangements for the student to complete the requirements in absentia.
The faculty member should immediately report the matter to the dean and department chair. The faculty member may also request the assistance of the dean of students to provide advice or to mediate the dispute.
A student who wishes to appeal the decision of the faculty member must submit the appeal in writing to the relevant academic dean within five working days of the decision. The dean will then conduct an investigation and respond to the student with a written decision within five working days. If during the appeal, the dean determines that the faculty member is possibly at fault, the dean may address the situation directly with the faculty member or may refer the matter to the provost for disposition. If the student is dissatisfied with this outcome, he or she may submit a written appeal to the provost, whose decision in these matters is final and binding. During this period of appeal, the student may not return to class. Even if the student’s appeal is successful, the student may not return to the class unless the faculty member has specifically agreed to this. If the provost upholds the earlier decision, the student may still be subject to the student conduct system for further conduct review at the discretion of the dean of students.
Academic Integrity Policy
Principle
Chapman University is a community of scholars that emphasizes the mutual responsibility of all members to seek knowledge honestly and in good faith. Students are responsible for doing their own work, and academic dishonesty of any kind will be subject to sanction by the instructor/administrator and referral to the University’s Academic Integrity Committee, which may impose additional sanctions up to and including expulsion.
This section of the website represents the Academic Integrity Policy of Chapman University as it pertains to students and to the responsibility of faculty in handling cases of alleged academic dishonesty, including research integrity.
Authority
The Academic Integrity Committee (AIC) is charged by the Faculty Senate under the Faculty Constitution and bylaws to be responsible for defining academic integrity and establishing policies and procedures for investigating, hearing and sanctioning alleged violations of academic integrity. The committee shall also make investigations and determinations of alleged violations of academic integrity policies and invoke the appropriate sanction as stipulated by Chapman University’s policies on academic integrity. The committee includes:

Faculty membership: The committee shall include at least three faculty members from diverse disciplines, one of whom must teach in graduate programs, plus the chair (at least four faculty total). All faculty members serve two-year, staggered terms.
Chair: The chair shall be elected from among the second year/returning faculty members.
Ex-officio members: The Dean of Students or their designee shall serve as an ex-officio, non-voting member.
Student members: One undergraduate student appointed by the Student Government Association and one graduate student appointed by the Graduate Student Council, shall serve on the committee.
Voting privileges: Faculty and student members serve as voting members of the committee.

Academic Integrity Violations 
Academic dishonesty can take a number of forms including, but not limited to the following:
Cheating: Using or attempting to use unauthorized assistance, information or study aids in any academic exercise.

Copying answers from or looking at another student’s exam.
Accessing or possessing any material not expressly permitted during an exam, such as crib sheets, notes, books.
Using electronic devices such as cell phones, digital cameras, PDA’s, data storage devices, computers, internet or other electronic devices unless expressly permitted by the instructor for the required coursework.
Continuing to write after a timed exam has ended.
Taking the exam from the room and later claiming the instructor lost it.
Fraudulent possession of a test prior to exam date.
Submission of the same term paper or other work to more than one instructor, where no prior approval has been given.
Submission of purchased term papers or projects done by others.

Allowing another student to copy one’s work.
Having another person take an exam or complete an assignment for oneself.
Taking an exam or completing an assignment for another student.

Plagiarism: Representing the words, research findings or ideas of another person as your own in any academic exercise. [At their discretion, faculty may submit student work to plagiarism-detection software, such as Turnitin for review without prior notice to students.]

Copying word for word without proper attribution.
Paraphrasing without proper attribution.
Using phrases from another source embedded into original material without proper attribution.
Copying of intellectual property without proper attribution.

Misrepresentation of Academic Records: Misrepresenting, tampering with or attempting to tamper with any university academic document, either before or after coming to Chapman University.

Violating applicable health, safety or ethical requirements in lab(s) or experiential clinical assignments.
Failing to observe rules of academic integrity established by a faculty member for a particular course.

Academic Integrity in Research
Chapman University students are expected to adhere to standards of ethics and integrity in research and scholarship. Misconduct in research includes fabrication, falsification, plagiarism or other practices that deviate significantly from those that are commonly accepted within the scholarly, creative and scientific community for proposing, conducting or reviewing research or in reporting research results. Key examples of such misconduct are listed below:
Plagiarism: 

Taking credit for someone else’s work and ideas, stealing others’ results or methods, copying the writing of others without acknowledgment or otherwise taking credit falsely.
Taking or releasing the data of others which were given in the expectation of confidentiality, e.g., appropriating ideas from submitted grant or contract proposals, or manuscripts for publication when one is a reviewer for granting agencies or journals.

Falsification of Data:

Dishonesty in reporting results, ranging from fabrication of data, improper recording of data, negligence in collecting or analyzing data, to selective reporting or omission of conflicting data.

Dishonesty in Presentation and Publication:

Knowingly presenting material or publishing articles that will mislead listeners or readers, e.g., misrepresenting data (particularly its originality).
Adding the names of other authors without permission or authors who have not earned the credit.
Citing unpublished papers without permission or including inadequate footnote or endnote attributions so that readers cannot tell who produced which data.
Publishing the same material more than once without identification of prior publication.
Serving as a coauthor of a research paper or article without reviewing the material to be published.

Violation of Regulations:

Failure to adhere to safe research practices or to receive the approval required for work under research regulations of federal, state, local or university agencies.
Failure to adhere to Chapman University Institutional Review Board research procedures.
Misuse of research funds.

Unethical Research Practices:

Failing to report episodes of misconduct or breaches of research ethics as set forth in this policy.

Legal Violations:

Stealing or destroying the property of others (research, research papers, supplies, equipment or products).
Misuse of research funds.

Academic Integrity Sanctions
Sanctions are determined by the instructor and/or the AIC. While sanctions may begin with a less severe action and then progress to more severe actions, the instructor and/or the AIC may initiate sanctions in any order, if in its opinion the circumstances so warrant. Nothing in the policy shall be construed to limit the right of the AIC to impose any form of discipline a student without a prior violation including suspension or expulsion. Generally, the order of recommended sanctions are as follows:
First violation: Instructor imposed sanction and a letter from the AIC. If the recommended sanction by the instructor (or the sanction imposed by the AIC which may be a warning, a recommendation for suspension or a recommendation for expulsion from the university) is an F grade for the course, the student cannot drop the course and the F grade cannot be eliminated by retaking the course.
Second (and subsequent) violations: Instructor imposed sanction, AIC sanction appropriate to the nature of the violation and a letter from the AIC. The AIC sanction may be a warning, a recommendation for suspension or a recommendation for expulsion from the University.
Possible Sanctions
The sanction given to a student is entirely up to the instructor/administrator based on the severity of the violation. The following are only examples of possible sanctions.

Disciplinary warning.
A make-up assignment that may be more difficult than the original assignment.
No credit for the original assignment/exam.
A failing grade on the assignment/exam.
A reduced final grade for the course.
A failing grade for the course.
Denial of access to internships or research programs.

Additional Information on Sanctions

If an alleged violation occurs at the Tutoring, Learning and Testing Center, the AIC will notify the faculty and student, leaving it up to the faculty to impose a sanction.
A student cannot withdraw from a course before receiving the violation notification from the AIC. If a student withdraws prior to notification, the AIC may reinstate the student to the course. 
After the sanction has been determined, a student may withdraw from the class with the instructor’s permission, providing that the alleged violation occurred before the university deadline for withdrawing, and provided the sanction is not a failure for the course. Withdrawing from a class does not automatically remove the violation report. 
A grade of F received as a result of an academic integrity violation cannot be removed from the calculation of the GPA should the course in question be repeated.
Any grade received as a result of a second academic integrity violation cannot be removed from the calculation of the GPA should the course in question be repeated.
For students taking a course P/NP, the letter grade of an “F” can be given as the sanction for an academic integrity violation.
The AIC sanction letter will be placed in the student’s file in the Office of the Provost along with the instructor’s report. 
A copy of the letter will also be sent to the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students and the University Registrar.
False statements made during the course of the process may result in additional sanction(s) and a referral to the Vice President for Student Affairs/Dean of Students for a Student Conduct Code violation.

Interim Action

The Provost or their designee involved may suspend the student from one or more classes, experiential clinics or labs for an interim period prior to resolution of the academic integrity proceeding if they believe that the information supporting the allegations of academic misconduct is reliable and determine that the continued presence of the student in classes or experiential assignments poses a significant threat to any person or property.
The Provost or their designee must provide a written notice of the interim suspension to the student, with a copy to the Provost and the Dean of Students Office. The interim suspension will become effective immediately on the date of the written notice.
A student who is suspended for an interim period may request a meeting with the Provost or their designee to review their decision and to respond to the allegations that they pose a threat, by making a written request to the Provost or their designee for a meeting. The Provost or their designee will schedule the meeting no later than five (5) days following receipt of the written request and decide whether the reasons for imposing the interim suspension are supported by the evidence.
The interim suspension will remain in effect until a final decision has been made on the pending academic misconduct charges or until the Provost or their designee, determines that the reasons for imposing the interim suspension no longer exist or are not supported by the available evidence.

Important Guidelines for Faculty

Course outlines should include the academic integrity principle statement and refer students to the catalog for more information.
To encourage compliance with academic integrity standards, instructors shall make an effort to explain to students at the outset of a course or the start of an examination the behavior expected of them when taking examinations or when preparing and submitting other course work. Further, faculty should actively monitor examinations. Additionally, at the faculty’s discretion, the faculty may submit work to plagiarism detection software, such as Turnitin for review without prior notice to students.
In all cases of alleged violations of academic integrity, faculty members must maintain confidentiality and not disclose information beyond those individuals who had a need to know.
Faculty must collect accurate records of an academic integrity violation and submit those records to the AIC chair at the Office of the Provost.
Faculty should encourage students who have been accused of an academic integrity violation to contact the Vice President for Student Affairs/Dean of Students or designee, who can serve as a resource.

Procedure for Faculty Charging a Student with a Violation
When a faculty member or member of the Tutoring, Learning and Testing Center staff has evidence of an alleged violation of the Academic Integrity Policy, the steps listed below should be followed:
1.  Notify the student by Chapman e-mail and/or personal communication of the allegation within 10 calendar days.
2.  Arrange a meeting with the student and course faculty member to be held as soon as possible, but at least within three (3) business days’ notice to the student. Any discussion of sanctions should be reserved for the meeting.

If the student fails to attend a scheduled initial meeting with the faculty without a compelling excuse, the student will lose their opportunity to appeal the violation report and/or sanction to the AIC.
An exception to meeting with the student may occur at the end of a semester when a student is no longer accessible for a meeting with the faculty member. In these cases, the faculty member should make every reasonable effort to contact the student by Chapman e-mail to discuss the matter. If reasonable attempts to contact the student fail, the instructor may resolve the issue by submitting an academic integrity violation report form, which the student has the right to later appeal to the AIC.
Both faculty and student may invite witnesses with first-hand information to the meeting who can knowledgeably provide relevant information about the alleged infraction.

3.  Request that a faculty designee of the AIC be present as an observer of the meeting at least 48 hours before the scheduled meeting time. Complete the online request form available on the academic integrity website. The AIC designee will:

Ensure that the student knows where to find the Academic Integrity Policy and direct the student to the catalog.
Inform the student that they have the right to appeal the violation report and/or sanction to the AIC based on the guidelines provided in the catalog for appealing a violation report and/or sanction to the AIC.
Advise the instructor to submit the report of academic integrity violation, no later than 14 calendar days after the meeting.
Observe, but not participate in deciding whether a violation has occurred or which sanction should be imposed.

4.  Be familiar with the guidelines for sanctions to determine an appropriate sanction for the type of violation.

A list of common instructor-imposed sanctions for various violations of academic integrity can be found in the academic integrity sanctions area.
Instructors are encouraged to use these guidelines to ensure consistency and fairness in assessing student sanctions.

5.  In the meeting, present the student with the allegation and all evidence in support of the charge against the student. The student should be given the opportunity to respond and, if they wish, to submit evidence refuting the allegation.
6.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the faculty member determines if it is more likely than not that the student has violated the Academic Integrity Policy, and if so, the faculty member charges the student with a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy.

If the student is found responsible, impose a suitable grade punishment. Examples of violations and common sanctions can be found above in this policy. Inform the student that they will receive a sanction letter from the AIC.
If the faculty member needs more time to decide on the case, give the student a reasonable timeframe for a response. A grade of Incomplete may also be assigned by the instructor if academic integrity is in question at the time grades are due and the instructor or AIC require more time to resolve the issue. (See Academic Policies and Procedures in the catalog for more details on “Incomplete Grades.”)

7.  After notifying the student of the sanction in writing by university e-mail, complete the academic integrity violation report form which can be found on the academic integrity website.
8.  The completed academic integrity violation report form and other pertinent documents must be submitted as soon as possible, but not later than 14 calendar days after the meeting unless there are exceptional circumstances and an extension has been granted by the AIC chair.
9.  The report/documents can be sent by the instructor to the AIC chair in the Office of the Provost. The form and documents may also be sent by e-mail to aic@chapman.edu. In most cases, submission of this form and documents will complete the academic integrity violation process for the faculty member.
10. The student will receive a letter of sanction from the AIC chair along with information for appealing the violation report and/or sanctions.
Important Guidelines for Students

Students should strictly avoid any appearance of academic dishonesty. This includes, but is not limited to: joking to others about cheating, permitting others to cheat off them, talking during examinations, plagiarizing, fabrication or falsification of information or forging documents. Students should keep their eyes on their own exams during examinations and protect their exams from the view of others.
Students should be aware and adhere to instructor guidelines for projects, papers and exam situations including use of appropriate citations. This includes the extent of independent and collaborative work allowed for an assignment. All electronic devices (cellular phones, tablets and computers) should be turned off and placed completely out of site during test situations, unless otherwise directed by the instructor.
Academic dishonesty can take a number of forms. Please see the academic integrity violations area for a number of examples.
Students who discover an apparent violation of this policy should report the matter to the instructor of record or if the instructor is not known or unavailable, to the Vice President of Student Affairs/Dean of Students.

Appealing to the Academic Integrity Committee
If the student accepts responsibility for the charge and the imposed sanction, then the matter is immediately resolved. If the allegation or founded violation represents a second violation of the Academic Integrity Policy, the AIC will review the case regardless of whether the student decides to appeal the violation report and/or sanction.
1.  Any student who has received an AIC sanction letter is encouraged to schedule a meeting with the Vice President for Student Affairs/Dean of Students or designee to discuss the situation prior to appealing the case.
2.  If the student disagrees with the violation report, the sanction, and/or the prohibition to withdraw, the student can appeal any of the above to the AIC by writing an appeal letter addressed to the AIC chair. The appeal letter and any supporting documents can be sent via e-mail to aic@chapman.edu.

Appeals must be made within 10 Chapman University business days from the date of the sanction letter.
In exceptional circumstances, a student may request additional time to appeal the violation report and/or sanction by e-mailing aic@chapman.edu, addressed to the AIC chair and extensions are granted at the sole non-appealable discretion of the AIC chair.
Requests for extensions must be made within ten (10) Chapman University business days of the date of the sanction letter.

3.  Appeals are not granted automatically as they must be thoughtful, well-reasoned and substantive and must demonstrate that at least one of the following criteria exists:

New evidence not available at the time of the meeting with the faculty member’s/administrator’s member has become available and is potentially sufficient to alter the faculty member’s/administrator’s decision.
There was a substantive procedural error made in charging the student
The sanction(s) imposed was not appropriate for the violation of Academic Integrity that occurred.
The facts in the case were insufficient to establish that a violation of the policy occurred.

Appeals must also include pertinent evidence supporting one of the above criteria and names of witnesses the student requests be called who have first-hand information about the matter. New evidence will not be accepted at the hearing unless it can be demonstrated that it could not have been known or available to the student at the time of the appeal. Evidence submitted will be reviewed by the AIC chair and may be denied if cumulative or not probative of the disputed facts or to the determination of the case.
4.  The AIC chair will notify the student via Chapman e-mail whether or not the AIC has determined that there are grounds to conduct a hearing. Should the AIC determine there are grounds to conduct a hearing, the AIC will notify the student of the hearing and where it will be held at least five (5) Chapman University business days in advance of the scheduled hearing date.
5.  If the AIC decides to hear the student’s case, the following individuals will be invited to participate:

The AIC chair and the AIC faculty members.
The student representatives on the AIC.
The Vice President for Student Affairs/Dean of Students or their designee (ex-officio, non-voting).
The student.
Any other persons called by the AIC chair, including material witnesses (such as the faculty member) whom the student or the AIC members deem relevant to the case.
The student may also invite one person to provide support (e.g., friend or family member). This support person may not speak for the student and this individual may not be an (practicing or non-practicing) attorney.
A quorum is necessary for all AIC business. A quorum is defined as three (3) voting members of the AIC.

6.  Should the student fail to appear at the hearing before the AIC, the AIC shall have full authority to proceed in the student’s absence. Any student that misses the scheduled hearing with the AIC forfeits the right to appeal the AIC’s decision to the Office of the Provost.

If for any reason, the student needs to reschedule the hearing with the AIC, the committee needs to receive a 24 hours’ notice. Hearings will be rescheduled only for exceptional circumstances at the sole non-appealable discretion of the AIC chair.

7.  At the start of the hearing, the student is invited to present their case. The student has the right to present relevant evidence supporting their claims that has been previously provided to the AIC in their appeal. The student should be brief, concise, and organized in presenting their case.

The AIC chair may conclude the hearing at any time should the committee feel that the student is straying from the relevant facts of the case or reasons for the violation report and/or sanction to be vacated.
Although the committee may ask the student to review briefly the events of the case, the student comments should focus primarily on specific reasons the violation report and/or sanction meet one of the above specified grounds for appeal.
AIC members may ask the student questions about the case for clarification.
The student and witnesses are expected to maintain proper decorum during the proceeding or risk being excused. If a student is excused, the hearing will continue in their absence.

8.  After the student has presented the case and all questions have been addressed, the student and faculty member will be excused and the AIC will deliberate. Deliberation may result in the following:

A decision to uphold, modify or overturn the initial sanction. The AIC reserves the right to modify or overturn the instructor’s sanction.
A determination that additional information is needed. In this case, the decision is suspended until all necessary information has been obtained. In this case, the student will be notified as soon as possible, but within a few days, after the meeting.

9.  After the AIC makes its decision, the chair will notify the student in writing and via Chapman e-mail. Decisions of the AIC are based on the standard of proof whether it is more likely than not that the student violated the Academic Integrity Policy of Chapman University.
Appealing to the Provost
If unsatisfied with the outcome of the AIC hearing to contest the violation report and/or sanction, the student may appeal the decision of the AIC to the Provost by e-mailing aic@chapman.edu within five (5) Chapman University business days of receiving the AIC decision letter. This period is known as “the appeal period.” A review will be conducted by the Provost or their designee.
In exceptional circumstances, a student may file a request to the Provost for an extension to the appeal period by e-mailing aic@chapman.edu. Requests for extensions must be made within the appeal period.
Appeals are not granted automatically as they must be thoughtful, well-reasoned and substantive and must demonstrate that at least one of the following criteria exists:

New evidence not available at the time of the hearing has become available and is potentially sufficient to alter a decision.
There was a substantive procedural error that may have prohibited the hearing from being conducted fairly in light of the violation report and/or sanction.
The sanction(s) imposed was not appropriate for the violation of Academic Integrity that occurred.
The facts in the case were insufficient to establish that a violation of the policy occurred.

Upon appeal, the Provost or their designee shall review the faculty member’s decision, sanctions and supporting evidence, and any evidence provided by the student, and may confer with the faculty member and the student. The Provost or their designee shall have the authority to uphold, modify, or overturn the AIC’s decision and sanctions.
The Provost or their designee shall notify the student, the faculty member and the Dean of Students in writing of their decision. The Provost or their designee’s decision is final on all Academic Integrity Policy violation cases. No further review or consideration will be granted following this decision.
