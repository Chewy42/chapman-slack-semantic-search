Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students






Student life at Chapman is educationally stimulating and diverse. Students come from varied economic, social, cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Yet because of Chapman’s size, opportunities for involvement are extended to all students through an active student government, student clubs and organizations, service and social fraternities and sororities, religious organizations, intercollegiate and intramural athletics, student publications, numerous social and cultural events and student media in drama, music, film and dance.
New Student Orientation
New student orientation provides programming that welcomes and facilitates the smooth transition of incoming students and their families to the campus community. Through fall and spring orientation, students acquire the knowledge and resources to prepare them for the opportunities, responsibilities, and experiences associated with being a member of the Chapman University community. Families gain important insight into the values, traditions, and resources of Chapman that will equip them to become better partners in the educational journey of their students.
Orientation activities also expose students to academics, student services, and co-curricular activities at Chapman. Through these activities, students and their families interact with Chapman faculty, staff, administrators, and other students, facilitating greater connections between the students and their new community. Through their participation in the orientation program, students will become aware of the many academic, social, leadership, service and cultural opportunities available to them.
In addition to orientation, first year students have the opportunity to participate in the following programs:
Emerging Leaders Retreat
The Emerging Leaders Retreat is a two-day program where students have opportunity to meet peers and learn more about leadership in a fun and interactive setting. Students may participate in one of the different leadership development tracks offered. Each track has a different focus while being centered on their development alongside their peers and the community. This is the perfect opportunity to explore ways to get involved at Chapman before the fall semester even begins.
First Generation Summer Bridge Program
The First-Generation Summer Bridge program is an optional support program held prior to orientation for first generation college students and their families at Chapman University. In collaboration with the Promising Futures Program, this event is facilitated by Chapman faculty, staff, and students, many of whom are or were first generation themselves.
International Student Pre-Orientation
International student pre-orientation is designed for new incoming international students to become acquainted with Chapman University a day prior to the start of the large orientation programs. It is highly encouraged that incoming international students take advantage of this opportunity.
PEER and Health Education
PEER stands for Proactive Education Encouraging Responsibility. This department provides students with information regarding alcohol and substance abuse, sexual assault prevention, communication and life skills, conflict resolution, STD prevention (including HIV/AIDS), stress reduction and other related mental, physical and social health issues. It also provides programming opportunities for students in many of these areas. This department is responsible for the educational component of The Healthy Panther Program and the Creating A Rape-free Environment for Students (CARES) Program.
Chapman’s PEER and Health Education department also provides students with opportunities to explore how high-risk choices can impact a person’s likelihood to achieve career and life goals. Wise decision-making, responsibility and awareness of consequences are key components of the many programs that this office sponsors. Students are encouraged to receive training to provide services to fellow students in the area of rape and sexual assault prevention education. Dr. Dani Smith serves as the Director of PEER and Health Education and is Chapman University’s Sexual Assault Crisis Counselor. For more information, please call (714) 744-7080 or stop by room 303F in Argyros Forum.
Residence Life and First Year Experience
Chapman University is committed to providing a residential living program with a strong community-building emphasis which enables our residents to both meet new people and experience new situations.
Housing Options
Chapman residence halls provide a variety of living options including single, double and triple occupancy rooms; some options are suites with a shared bath while others have private bathrooms.
In addition to traditional residence halls, Chapman University housing also offers several apartment communities for students.
Housing for First Year Students
All first-year students arriving in the fall will be placed by their academic college or school. First-year communities are typically located in Pralle-Sodaro Hall, Henley Hall, Glass Hall, Morlan Hall, and Sandhu Residence Center. Students living in Pralle-Sodaro Hall, Henley Hall, Glass Hall or Sandhu Residence Center should expect to live in a triple assignment.
Housing for Continuing Students
Housing for continuing students (i.e., sophomores, juniors, seniors) is located in Glass Hall, Sandhu Residence Center, Davis Apartments, Harris Apartments, Panther Village Apartments, The K Apartments, and Chapman Grand.
Living in Chapman Housing
Students live in small, community-based groups. They take an active role in shaping their community through programs and activities developed with the assistance of a Resident Advisor, other student staff, and a live-in professional staff member.
Additional facilities in the residence life area include the Doti-Struppa rock climbing wall in the Sandhu Residence Center and the Henley Hall Fitness Center on the basement level of Henley Hall. A community kitchen area is also available in Morlan Hall for any resident student’s use.
The residence life area also offers several outdoor recreation facilities, including a sand volleyball court, a basketball court and the Masson Family Beach Club which features a pool and deck with lounge chairs.
With a strong focus on community, the staff provides hundreds of social and educational programs for students each semester. Many students take advantage of residential leadership opportunities, including Community Councils, student employment opportunities, and more.
Restaurant Services
Chapman University Restaurant Services is more than great food. It is a community centered on culinary expertise, fresh ingredients, healthy options and a shared sense of environmental and social responsibility. The Restaurant Services team is committed to creating the best possible dining experience that provides students with the opportunity to to enjoy the comfort, convenience, outstanding food and inviting atmosphere designed especially for them. Restaurant Services offers several meal plans which serve the diverse backgrounds, tastes, and schedules of both residential and commuter students as well as faculty and staff. The team mission is to embrace personalized services and accommodate special diets physician-prescribed and preference-related, including vegan and vegetarian. Campus community members may save up to 59 percent off on all Chapman restaurants when ordering a commuter meal plan. The Chapman commuter meal plan is located on the Student Dining at Chapman website.

Simple Servings provides safe and appetizing choices for anyone with food allergies, gluten intolerance, or who prefer simple foods.
In addition to Randall, Chapman Restaurant Services hosts seven retail restaurants across campus including Jamba Juice, Einstein Brothers Bagels, Sub-Connection and Qdoba Mexican Grill, all located in Argyros Forum.

Student Affairs Policies
Student Conduct Code
Chapman University expects that all students adhere to the policies that govern student behavior outlined in the Student Conduct Code. The University is specifically concerned when individual student and organizational behavior directly interfere with the University’s primary educational objectives and functions or the rights and safety of others. Chapman believes that the conduct process has a role in developing a sense of responsibility and accountability in students, while being life preparatory. To that end, the University uses education and counseling, in addition to formal conduct proceedings to bring about these outcomes. Every Chapman student is presumed to have sufficient maturity, intelligence and concern for the rights of others and the rights of the institution to help maintain established standards of the academic community. When a student or organization’s behavior demonstrates otherwise, the University will consider conduct proceedings as deemed necessary. For details regarding institutional policies governing student conduct or the disciplinary process, please visit the Chapman University Student Conduct Code website, or the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students website. 
Healthy Panther
Chapman’s Healthy Panther Initiative (HPI) embodies the philosophy that learning to make healthy decisions is not only an important part of college education, it is essential to achieving personal and academic aspirations. The definition of a Healthy Panther includes:

A student who consistently respects her or his community and others.
A student who, if sexually active, consistently practices safer sex.
A student who is knowledgeable about alcohol and other drugs and their effects on the body and decisions.
A student who develops a healthy plan for herself or himself and sticks with it.
A student who drinks in moderation or not at all.

The Healthy Panther Initiative provides students with learning beyond formal education, knowledge about alcohol and other drugs and their effects on the body. The program’s goal is to provide essential information that will educate students about the effects of alcohol on the individual and how it can affect not only the individual, but also the individual’s societal surroundings; thus, empowering the individual to expand their coping skills regarding healthy relationships and decision making, enabling them to take control of their life choices and make positive decisions. Healthy Panther Initiative also educates students regarding affirmative consent, active bystander intervention skills, and related sexual violence prevention issues. Research has shown that combining motivational interviewing with an online feedback system can help students reduce risky behaviors. The HPI has two distinct components that must be completed by all new undergraduate students:
Part 1: The first part of Healthy Panther initiative involves an interactive group presentation focusing on high risk behaviors during which all new undergraduate students will be introduced to or reminded of the potential consequences of these behaviors, including alcohol poisoning, rape and sexual assault and the spread of HIV and other STDs. The session lasts approximately 75 minutes and attempts to enhance student coping skills; thus, empowering students to take control of their lives and choices, while introducing them to services provided here at Chapman.
Part 2: The second component is the completion of a follow-up survey. Approximately six weeks following the presentation, students will receive a follow-up survey through their Chapman email account from SurveyMonkey. Once the student completes the 30-minute survey they will have completed the Healthy Panther Initiative.
Chapman University students and their guests are expected to abide by all federal, state and local laws, as well as Chapman policies governing the use of alcohol and drugs. This requires that students and their guests not only have knowledge of these various laws and policies, but also are responsible and mature decision makers. Chapman University seeks to impart this knowledge and these values first and foremost through educational means relying heavily on positive staff and faculty role modeling, the formation and use of a peer education network and curriculum infusion whenever possible. Factual information and knowledge regarding alcohol and drugs, skills and strategies for achieving and maintaining healthy behaviors, creation of a cooperative and consistent campus peer environment and compliance with all local and federal regulations are components of this educational agenda. Illegal and abusive use of alcohol and other drugs by any member of the campus community constitutes an untenable threat to the community and signals a need for intervention on the part of the University. All campus event use of alcohol must be approved via an alcohol use permit. For further details, refer to the Chapman University Alcohol and Substance Abuse Policy or visit the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students website.
Financial Responsibility
It is expected that students shall be responsible for their financial obligations, both to the University and to the larger community. Students who do not meet their financial obligations may be prevented from further enrollment at Chapman and may be subject to conduct review.
Firearms and Fireworks
The possession or use of firearms, fireworks or other explosives is prohibited on campus and may be grounds for immediate dismissal.
Freedom of Speech and Expression
Freedom of speech and expression are especially important values within an academic community. Thus, with few exceptions, all topics are appropriate for discussion and debate within the framework of academic inquiry and within the context of the University’s pedagogical interests. Students and student organizations are free to examine and discuss all questions of interest to them and to express opinions publicly and privately. Students are free to support causes by orderly means, which do not disrupt the regular and essential operation of the institution. Within these broad parameters, the University may restrict expression that violates the law, is disruptive in the contexts of time, place or manner, constitutes a genuine threat or harassment against another person or persons, invades privacy or confidentiality interests, is otherwise directly incompatible with the functioning of the University, or interferes with the rights of others to engage in free expression. In their public expressions or demonstrations, students or student organizations speak only for themselves and may not speak on behalf of the institution.
Grievance Procedures
Students who have concerns about campus academic policies, procedures, other policies, treatment by faculty or other campus employees or concerns about college operations are encouraged to bring those concerns or complaints to the attention of the appropriate campus personnel.
For academic matters, the process normally begins with the faculty member involved. Appeals typically go to the department chair, the academic dean, the Undergraduate Academic Council, and then the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education. For non-academic matters (issues related to departments such as residence life, facilities management, business office, etc.), students should first discuss the matter with the head of the appropriate department with appeals to the appropriate supervisor. Students unsure of whom to contact should consult with the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students for appropriate referral.
Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation Prevention Policy
Chapman University is committed to providing an environment which is free from any form of harassment and discrimination based upon an individual’s race, color, religion, sex, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, age, marital status, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, sex, sexual orientation, military or veteran status, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by applicable state or federal law, so that all members of the community are treated at all times with dignity and respect. The University is also committed to providing an environment which is free of sexual harassment in any form. Therefore, it is the University’s policy to prohibit all forms of such harassment or discrimination among University faculty, students, staff, and administrators. Independent contractors and other third parties at the University are also expected to conform their conduct to the University’s Discrimination, Harassment, and Relaliation Prevention Policy. The University’s ability to take action against third parties may be limited and is determined by their context of the prohibited conduct and the nature of the relationship to the parties and the University.
View the entire copy of Chapman University’s Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation Prevention Policy on the Equal Opportunity Office webpage.
The University’s administrative, faculty, staff, and students are each responsible for creating and maintaining an environment conducive to work, study, and learning and for cooperating with University officials who investigate allegations of policy violations. It is the duty of every member of the faculty, staff, and administration to assure compliance with the policy by promptly reporting allegations of the policy violations to the University’s Equal Opportunity Office. Students are also strongly encouraged to report any alleged violations of this policy and may do so by reporting the violation to the Equal Opportunity Officer.
In keeping with its policies, Chapman University not only fully complies with all local, state, and federal laws concerning harassment and discrimination, but also provided a means to assure fair treatment to any student, employee, or member of the University community who believes the policy prohibiting harassment, discrimination, and sexual harassment has been violated. For further information, concerning Chapman University’s Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation Prevention Policy, please contact the University’s Director of Equal Opportunity at (714) 997-6847.
Hazing and Disruptive Conduct
Hazing or other activities that interfere with the normal operation of the University or infringe on the safety of other members of the University community including obstructing an academic class or lecture, administrative support function or University event or business is prohibited. Additionally, failure to comply with the requests of University officials may result in a referral to student conduct. For additional information, please see the Student Conduct Code.
Local, State and Federal Laws
Students attending Chapman are subject to local, state, and federal laws. When studying outside of the United States as a student of Chapman, they are subject to the laws of the applicable foreign jurisdiction(s). Chapman reserves the right to impose institutional sanctions for violations of public laws, even when such violations occur off University property. Students may also be subject to civil and/or criminal charges for offenses on Chapman property, if such offenses are in violation of local, state or federal laws, in addition to any accountability that they may face under the Student Conduct Code or other University policies.
Rights and Privacy Act/Confidentiality of Educational Records
Chapman’s policy regarding confidentiality is in keeping with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which affords students certain rights with respect to their education records, a summary of which follows:

The right to inspect and review the student’s own education records within 45 days of the day Chapman University receives a request for access.
The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes are inaccurate.
The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student’s education records.
The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failure by Chapman University to comply with the requirements of FERPA.

One exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by Chapman University in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law enforcement personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom Chapman University has contracted to serve as its agent or to provide services in support of its operation (such as an attorney, auditor, collection agent, degree conferral & transcript processing agent, document managing agent, and placement sites for internship or similar student work/study opportunities); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks; consultants, volunteers or other outside parties to whom Chapman University has outsourced institutional services or functions that it would otherwise use employees to perform. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility.
As allowed within FERPA guidelines, Chapman University may disclose requested education records to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll, without consent of the student.
At its discretion, Chapman University may provide public directory information in accordance with the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Directory information is defined as information that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. Students may withhold directory information by notifying the University Registrar in writing.
A complete text of Chapman’s annual notification to students of their rights under FERPA is contained on the website of the Office of the University Registrar.
