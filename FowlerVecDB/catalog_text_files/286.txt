The School of Communication is committed to maintaining an academic and social environment in which students may develop into inquiring thinkers who communicate productively in society. We do so by exposing students to theories and research emanating from the communication discipline and by providing them with opportunities to apply their knowledge and practice communication principles in varied settings. Students learn and practice the skills important for developing and sustaining high quality, ethical relationships in personal, professional, and global contexts.
Lambda Pi Eta is chartered and sponsored by the National Communication Association which meets on a regular basis to network and promote the field of communication studies. Guest speakers include members of the community, alumni, internship supervisors and faculty. The student club is open to all School of Communication majors and is organized and run by the students. Membership includes a certificate from the national office along with other networking materials and opportunities.
Chapman Radio offers students the opportunity to work with Chapman University’s own radio station, heard on campus and around the world via the Internet (www.chapmanradio.com). Students may participate by having their own radio show or by helping to produce radio shows for others. Other opportunities include programming, publicity and promotion. The Chapman radio workshop also offers university credit for participation in this activity.
Honors at Graduation
The School of Communication awards honors to graduating seniors who have demonstrated exceptional academic achievement. Requirements for consideration include a GPA of 3.700 or higher in the major and a cumulative GPA of 3.500 or higher.
