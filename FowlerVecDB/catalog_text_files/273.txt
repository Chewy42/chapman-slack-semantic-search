Key Elements
Chapman University, founded in 1861, is an independent, comprehensive mid-sized private institution dedicated to providing a solid foundation of knowledge that enables its graduates to become fully educated persons. The University comprises the George L. Argyros School of Business and Economics; Donna Ford Attallah College of Educational Studies; Lawrence and Kristina Dodge College of Film and Media Arts; Crean College of Health and Behavioral Sciences; Dale E. And Sarah Ann Fowler School of Engineering; Wilkinson College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences; Dale E. Fowler School of Law; School of Communication; College of Performing Arts; School of Pharmacy and Schmid College of Science and Technology.
Chapman is recognized for its blend of professional programs, sciences and liberal arts, as well as its distinguished faculty, innovative programs and personalized attention to students. The University strives to develop in students the ability to think clearly, communicate effectively, explore issues from contrasting points of view, value human and cultural diversity and make informed ethical judgments in an increasingly complex world.
History
Chapman University traces its roots back more than a century and a half to Hesperian College, which opened on the same day that Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated as the sixteenth U.S. president in 1861. Hesperian and several other institutions later merged with California Christian College in Los Angeles. In 1934, the institution was renamed in recognition of its most generous benefactor, C.C. Chapman, successful real estate investor, church leader, politician and citrus grower. Chapman College moved to the city of Orange in 1954. In September of 1991, the college became Chapman University, further strengthening its commitment to international education and an innovative undergraduate curriculum and graduate programs.
Academic Programs
The University offers more than 40 fields of undergraduate study as well as graduate degree programs and credential programs for educators.
More information about Chapman’s dual degree and other graduate programs can be found in the Graduate Catalog available from the Office of Admission, Argyros Forum, Room 304, One University Drive, Orange, CA 92866 (714) 997-6786.
Chapman’s undergraduate programs are founded in the liberal arts. The University offers B.A., B.S., B.F.A. and B.M. degrees. As defined in the general education program, the University is dedicated to offering a distinctive education that encourages students to see and appreciate the linkages between their majors and the general education program. See index listing for undergraduate programs.
Chapman offers several programs that link together undergraduate and graduate programs to allow a student to complete both undergraduate and graduate programs in a shorter period of time than completing each degree separately. For more information on these programs see the index for Accelerated Undergraduate-Graduate Programs.
Information about courses through Brandman University is available in the Brandman University catalog available from the Office of Admission, 16355 Laguna Canyon Road, Irvine, CA 92618 (800) 746-0082.
General Education
The General Education program reflects the University’s mission to provide its students with a personalized education of distinction that leads to inquiring, ethical and productive lives as global citizens. The program is thus flexible, but enables all students to develop ability in critical inquiry, gain breadth and depth of knowledge, integrate knowledge within and across disciplines, cultivate ethical awareness in learning and practice, engage in experiential learning as thoughtful, principled citizens and become independent thinkers able to sustain a lifelong desire for intellectual growth.
Students may share up to nine credits between General Education and their major discipline and six credits between General Education and their minor discipline. Courses may not double-count in General Education categories; students may use a course to satisfy one inquiry or exploration category only.
For further information on the Chapman University General Education Program see “General Education Program ” in the Undergraduate Degree Requirements section of the catalog.

University Honors Program
The Chapman University Honors program is a broad interdisciplinary course of study based on great books and events from cultures around the world. Students and faculty concentrate on mutually critical exchanges between the classics of human cultures and the contemporary world. The goal of these dialogical exchanges is collaborative and intentional learning in which students and faculty together connect enduring and emerging ideas, drawing on shared texts, lectures, seminar discussions and cultural experiences.
Students in this university-wide program are required to complete a minimum of 24 credits. They select from a variety of courses in three main categories (human sciences, natural sciences and social sciences). During their first year in the program, honors students enroll in the three credit course, Honors Forum, and complete the Honors program with the three credit course, Honors Capstone.
Completion of the program satisfies the GE Inter/Multidisciplinary Cluster (Exploration Focus); select courses may also satisfy major, minor, other GE and/or elective requirements.
Applicants typically have first-rate GPAs and highly competitive SAT and ACT scores. Other criteria may include outstanding leadership and/or creative achievement, community involvement and a range of interests and experiences. The program best serves students who approach their education in a mature and responsible manner.
Acceptance to the program is limited. Students must submit a separate application for admission to the Honors program, in addition to applying for admission to the University. Students already at Chapman may also apply for admission, prior to accumulating 60 credits. Transfer students who come to Chapman after completing 60 credits and are accepted into the program are required to complete 15 credits, including the three credit course, Honors Forum, at least one course from each of the three main categories and complete the Honors program with the three credit course, Honors Capstone. Applications are available online at www.chapman.edu/academics/honors.
Faculty
The more than 522 full-time (517 instructional, 5 research) and 595 part-time faculty represent an outstanding range of intellectual interests, research endeavors and creative activities. They include noted researchers in the sciences and social sciences, gifted artists, prolific writers, talented film makers and widely published and recognized scholars.
As a community, the faculty is comprised of people who connect active scholarship and creative activity with teaching and learning as a bridge between research and practice. Their research and creative work informs both their teaching and their lives in ways that enable students to see the value of a commitment to lifelong learning. Some 86 percent hold terminal degrees and 47 percent are tenured. Full-time faculty teach two to three courses a term.
Student Body
The 2018-2019 student body population was 9,608, 7,026 of whom were degree -seeking undergraduate students. Over 90% of first year undergraduate students live in university housing, and 39% of all undergraduate students live in university housing.
Chapman welcomes students from around the country and the world. Chapman undergraduate students represent 47 states in the U.S. and 59 countries. The international undergraduate student population is about 4%. First Generation students are 20% of the undergraduate student body.
Enrollment has steadily grown since the early 1990s. The average SAT score of new freshmen has increased every year during that period. Chapman upholds its tradition of providing personalized education to students by maintaining a faculty to student ratio of 1:14.
Student Life
Student life at Chapman is educationally stimulating and diverse. Students come from varied economic, social, cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Yet because of Chapman’s size, opportunities for involvement are extended to all students through an active student government, academic and social fraternities and sororities, religious organizations, intercollegiate and intramural athletics, student publications, numerous social and cultural events and student productions in drama, music, film and dance.
Athletics
Chapman’s long and distinguished heritage in intercollegiate sports includes six NCAA national championships in baseball, tennis and softball. Students participate in NCAA Division III athletics, a non-scholarship division. Men’s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, crew (club sport), football, golf, ice hockey (club sport), lacrosse (club sport), soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field and water polo. Women’s sports include basketball, cross country, crew (club sport), golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, volleyball and water polo. Approximately 20 percent of Chapman’s student body participates in intercollegiate athletics, club sports or intramurals. Chapman University is a member of the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.
Student athletes as well as all students and members of the Chapman community who wish to keep physically fit have access to the facilities in the award-winning and uniquely designed Erin J. Lastinger Athletics Complex (which opened in August 2008). The facility includes the fully rebuilt 1,923-seat Ernie Chapman Stadium and Holly and David Wilson Field, constructed atop a 900 capacity underground parking facility. The Allred Aquatics Center and Olympic Pool features the 600-seat Frank E. and Mary Ann O’Bryan Aquatics Stadium and houses Chapman’s aquatics programs. The Lastinger Complex earned the “Facility of Merit” award at the Athletic Business Conference in 2010. The Harold Hutton Sports Center is home to Chapman’s indoor sports and seats 2,400 for basketball and volleyball competitions. Hutton also houses the Julianne Argyros Fitness Center open to the Chapman community. And in 2017, the Erin J.

Independent internships are graded by the student’s Faculty Internship Advisor on a Pass/No Pass  basis. Seminar internships may be subject to letter grade.
If an internship for a seminar course is not secured by the 5th week of the term per the academic calendar, the student is expected to withdraw from the course, resulting in an automatic W notation on their transcript.

Church Relationship
Chapman’s roots are firmly grounded in its historic covenant with our founders, the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). That rich spiritual legacy lives on through Chapman’s focus on the development of the ethical, spiritual and intellectual person. A variety of religious studies courses and spiritual programming activities are offered, but not required. The dean of the chapel oversees an active interfaith program designed to meet the spiritual needs of the University’s students, faculty and staff. A full-time director of church relations strengthens the University’s covenant with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) as well as provides programs for the broader community. As of 2010, Chapman University is also recognized by the United Church of Christ as a church-related school. Honoring this connection, there is a special student ministry and scholarship program for students from Disciples and United Church of Christ backgrounds. Both the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and the United Church of Christ respect the many paths to God and strongly support Chapman’s nurturing of students, faculty and staff of all faith backgrounds, as well as those who are atheist or agnostic. (For more information about the Disciples and United Church of Christ program, go to www.chapman.edu/about/church-relations/.
Chapman University embraces four pillars of education: intellectual, social, physical, and spiritual. The dean of the chapel supports a host of religious and spiritual groups including progressive and evangelical Protestants, Roman Catholics, Latter-day Saints, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Baha’is, Shikhs, Wiccans and those exploring meditation, health and healing and intersections between religion and other intellectual disciplines. New groups may be formed to support the interests and needs of the current student body. Major religious conferences and speakers are hosted each year. (For more information, visit www.chapman.edu/about/fish-interfaith-center/.)
In addition to the chaplaincy services of the director and associate director of church relations and the dean of the chapel, there is also a director of Jewish life and a director of Muslim life who serve their unique populations in addition to the entire campus.
The beautiful Fish Interfaith Center houses the Wallace All Faiths Chapel, Wilkinson Founders Chapel, Yoder Sanctuary, Peterson Conference Room, The Fashionables Courtyard, Dee’s Garden of the Senses, a lounge, administrative offices and a columbarium. A team of internationally known architects and artists cooperated in the design of this inspirational and award-winning sacred space, which opened in 2004.

Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC)
AFROTC is a nationwide program that allows students to pursue commissions (become officers) in the United States Air Force (USAF) while simultaneously attending college. AFROTC classes are held on college campuses throughout the United States and Puerto Rico; students can register through normal course registration processes. AFROTC consists of four years of Aerospace Studies classes (Foundations of the USAF, Evolution of USAF and Space Power, Air Force Leadership Studies, and National Security Affairs/Preparation for Active Duty), and a corresponding Leadership Laboratory for each year (where students apply leadership skills, demonstrate command and effective communication, develop physical fitness, and practice military customs and courtesies). College students enrolled in the AFROTC program (known as “cadets”) who successfully complete both AFROTC training and college degree requirements will graduate and simultaneously commission as Second Lieutenants in the Active Duty Air Force. The AFROTC program is currently offered at California State University, San Bernardino, but they have a crosstown agreement that allows our students to enroll in AFROTC and become full-fledged cadet participants. For more information on AFROTC course descriptions, please review catalog.csusb.edu. For more information on the AFROTC program, please review afrotc.csusb.edu for general information and csbs.csusb.edu/afrotc/afrotc-at-csusb/courses for more detailed course information.

Aerospace studies classes and leadership laboratories are conducted at various times during the week on the main campuses of CSUSB, LMU and USC.
AFROTC offers a variety of two, three and four year scholarships, many of which pay the full cost of tuition, books and fees. Successful completion of as little as six (three years) semesters of AFROTC academic classes and leadership laboratories can lead to a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force.
Classes consist of one hour of academics and two hours of laboratory for first-year students and sophomores and three hours of academics and two hours of laboratory for juniors and seniors. All cadets must participate in two one-hour sessions of physical training. All curriculum is taught on Fridays. AFROTC cadets under scholarship and all juniors and seniors receive a monthly tax-free stipend and a textbook allowance.
