Policies and Procedures
While requirements vary in each of Chapman University’s graduate programs, this section provides information concerning University-wide admission standards as well as general admission policies and procedures. For specific program admission requirements, refer to the appropriate program section.
An applicant seeking admission to a graduate program must submit evidence of eligibility for admission, including a completed application form, the application fee, official copies of transcripts from degree granting institutions attended and any additional evidence of eligibility required by the graduate program. Upon meeting these eligibility requirements, applicants may be admitted to a graduate program.
All admission procedures must be completed by the end of the first term in which the coursework is taken or the applicant will not be permitted to enroll in further coursework.
Requirements for Admissions
Baccalaureate Degree
With the exception of Doctor of Pharmacy FEAP program, admission to graduate programs at Chapman requires the completion of a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited institution. Baccalaureate degrees from non-regionally accredited institution are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and subject to approval by the Dean of the School. International applicants must have a completed baccalaureate degree from either a regionally accredited U.S. institution, or an accredited or government approved foreign institution. This must be documented by an official transcript and diploma showing the baccalaureate degree was earned. Students who cannot provide official evidence of completing a baccalaureate degree upon application for admission are permitted to enroll for a maximum of one semester, during which time official evidence of a completed baccalaureate degree must be provided.
The baccalaureate-granting institution must have been accredited at the time the degree was awarded.
Master’s Degree
Admission to certain PhD programs requires a completion of a master’s degree from a regionally accredited institution. Refer to the appropriate program section in the graduate catalog for individual PhD program requirements. The master’s granting institution must have been accredited at the time the degree was awarded.
Grade Point Average
The University-wide grade point requirement for admission to graduate degree programs is a cumulative grade point average of 3.000. Applicants who have an admission grade point average between 2.500 and 2.999 may be admitted upon submission of a satisfactory score on an accepted graduate admission examination; some programs may require an exam regardless of grade point average. Acceptable graduate admission exams for specific programs can be found on the appropriate program section of the graduate catalog.
Students seeking admission with a minimum required grade point average, but fewer than 60 graded semester credits, must submit an admission examination score; the graded credits must include 36 upper-division credits.
Admission Examinations
While some programs require submission of a graduate admission test score from all applicants, regardless of GPA, others adhere to the general University standard and require an admission examination for applicants that have a cumulative grade point average below a 3.000. For credential program applicants, an admission examination is required for applicants who have a cumulative grade point average below a 2.750. For Marriage, Family and Therapy applicants, an admission examination is required for applicants who have a cumulative grand point average below 3.3. Refer to the appropriate program section for specific admission exam information, including a list of acceptable exams.
Chapman University accepts scores from the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), the California Subject Examinations for Teachers (CSET), the Miller Analogies Test (MAT), and the Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT). Not all examinations are accepted by all programs. Consult the departmental sections for specific test and score requirements.
Program Requirements
Most degree programs have specific admission requirements in addition to the University requirements listed above. Consult the appropriate program section for additional information and specific admission requirements.
Admission Classification
Regular Admission
Applicants who fulfill all admission requirements of the University and the specific graduate program may be granted regular admission. These admission requirements include the following:

A completed baccalaureate degree with a minimum of 36 graded upper-division credits from a regionally accredited institution in the United States or an accredited institution abroad.
A cumulative grade point average of 3.000 from the degree granting institution.
Fulfillment of all specific program admission requirements.

Final Documents
Applicants whose final completion of the baccalaureate degree is pending at the time of application or their degree has been completed but not yet conferred can be admitted. Final transcripts with degree posting are required to complete their admission file.
Students who complete coursework, but who do not complete the admission application process (or who are denied and later achieve admission) will be permitted to use only 12 credits of completed coursework toward a degree program.
Applicants who can provide documentation from the degree granting institution, verifying that the degree has been completed, will be eligible for financial aid.
Admission Procedures

Complete the application for admission to graduate study.
Submit official transcripts from all degree conferring institutions attended (degree conferral must be indicated) including all baccalaureate degrees, post-baccalaureate graduate coursework and advanced degrees (if applicable). An official transcript should be sent directly by the issuing institution to the Office of Graduate Admission. Send transcripts to: Office of Graduate Admission, Chapman University, Argyros Forum, Room 213, One University Drive, Orange, California 92866. These transcripts become the property of the University.
Remit the non-refundable application fee of $60, payable to Chapman University.

Readmission/Re-Enrollment Policies and Procedures

Former Chapman students who wish to be readmitted to the University for a new or additional degree program should contact the Office of Admission.
Re-Enrollment is required for all graduate students who have broken enrollment for a period of more than one semester/trimester without receiving an approved Leave of Absence. On the Orange Campus, interterm and summer sessions do not constitute a semester for graduate programs that are not on a 12-month calendar.
Contact the Office of the Registrar to initiate the re-enrollment process.
To be eligible for re-enrollment, you must have a cumulative 3.000 GPA and no grade below a “C” in Chapman University graduate coursework.
Re-enrollment must be approved by the program of study.
All students are held to the admission regulations and requirements in effect at the time of their return. For example, students cannot fulfill programmatic degree requirements in effect for one graduate catalog and admission or prerequisite requirements in effect for a different graduate catalog. (See section on leave of absence for more information regarding this policy.)
Re-enrollment does not void the seven-year limitation for completion of all degree requirements.
Veterans receiving an honorable discharge, who left in order to perform military services, will be readmitted with the same academic status he or she had when last in attendance at Chapman University. The length of absence from Chapman University cannot exceed five years. Veterans returning to Chapman may select their academic program so long as:
	
The program or credential is still being offered by Chapman University.
The program or credential is not an impacted program calling for selective admission.
The program or credential has not had significant changes due to regulatory requirements.



Admission Procedures for International Students
International students must submit the following prior to admission:

Application for graduate program of study.
Application fee of $60.
Official or unofficial transcripts (with English translation) from degree granting institutions must be submitted for evaluation. If granted admission, students will be required to submit official transcripts to complete their admission file. There are additional admission requirements for different programs; refer to the specific program for further information.
Upon admission, applicants must file a Graduate International Student Supplemental Form with the University, showing financial ability to cover all obligations for the first year of study at Chapman. This form should be accompanied with a statement from either a United States bank or agency, or an international bank, dated within six months of the starting date of the program. The United States Department of Immigration and Naturalization Form I-20 Certificate of Eligibility will not be issued until such documentation is on file in the Office of Graduate Admission.
International applicants whose native language is not English must submit scores of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), International English Language Testing System (IELTS), Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE Academic) or Cambridge English: Advanced (CAE).
