The George L. Argyros School of Business and Economics’ programs prepare students to assume leadership roles in business organizations in a dynamic market economy. Successful graduates, grounded in economic reasoning with an understanding of the role of markets, will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to identify and evaluate opportunities throughout the world and mobilize the resources to exploit them.
Placement Exam Policy for Waiver of Prerequisite Courses
From time to time, students or prospective students may request waiver of prerequisite courses for a program. These students may not otherwise meet the prerequisite requirements because of one of the following reasons:

The student took the course more than 7 years ago,
The student took the course previously at an international university where equivalency is difficult to determine, or
The student took the course previously but did not attain the C+ minimum requirement.

If they do not otherwise meet the prerequisite requirements, students may request to take a placement exam to display their understanding of core course material in order to seek waiver of a prerequisite course.
The Argyros School of Business will maintain separate placement exams for each prerequisite course which will be created using exams from existing courses and in consultation with instructors for those courses to ensure that the core material is represented on the exam.
Students who attain a score of 70% or higher on the placement exam will be granted a waiver of the prerequisite course.
