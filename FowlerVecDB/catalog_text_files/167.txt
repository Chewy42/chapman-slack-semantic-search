Center for Global Education
Study Abroad
Students are encouraged to participate in a semester or academic year abroad. There are courses and programs to choose in all majors in almost every part of the world. Studying overseas provides a unique opportunity for fresh perspectives on international political, economic and social issues, interpersonal relationships and ultimate career choices. All regularly enrolled Chapman students with a minimum 3.000 GPA and at least a sophomore standing are eligible to participate. Many programs offered require no previous foreign language study. Students studying abroad through Chapman-approved programs are enrolled in a full course of study at the host institution and receive Chapman credit. Students are often pleasantly surprised to learn that the cost for studying abroad is comparable to the current cost of studying at Chapman. Most financial aid can apply depending on the program selected. The semester and academic year programs directly support Chapman’s emphasis on encouraging students to recognize and develop their roles as global citizens in an increasingly interdependent world. When enrolled full-time, students who complete a semester or more abroad automatically satisfy the Global Study portion of the General Education program. Courses taken abroad can satisfy major, minor or applicable General Education area requirements.
Exchange Programs
University wide and major-specific exchange programs bring international students to Chapman and allow Chapman students to fully integrate in a foreign university for a semester or academic year. Many universities have courses taught in English. There are opportunities for students to immerse themselves in language and culture programs. All regularly enrolled Chapman students with a minimum 3.000 GPA are eligible to apply. Typically, a student must have a junior standing to participate, although some programs welcome sophomores. Students studying abroad through Chapman-approved programs are enrolled in a full course of study at the host institution and receive Chapman credit.
Travel Courses
Chapman faculty representing a wide range of academic departments lead domestic and international Travel Courses during the January interterm or summer session(s) for one to four weeks. All students are encouraged to participate in these courses in order to gain a broader perspective of other cultures. Participation in any Travel Course is authorized by the faculty group leader. Credit is awarded for the academic work involved in each program and may apply towards the Global Study portion of the general education requirements. Students may be eligible for a tuition waiver for their participation in a travel program.
International Internships
International Internships promote a rich cultural immersion and advance students practical work experience, communication skills, leadership and teamwork. Internships help students prepare for a diverse and developing global industry. All programs are open to juniors and seniors in any major with a 3.000 or higher GPA. Students intern eight weeks and earn three credits, which can count towards the Global Study portion of the general education requirements. Students may be eligible for a tuition waiver for their participation in a Chapman Summer International Internship.

Disability Services
Students with disabilities may register with the University’s Disability Services office for accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. It is the responsibility of the student requesting accommodations to make these needs known in a timely fashion and to provide proper documentation and evaluations as required. The granting of any accommodation will not be retroactive and cannot jeopardize the academic standards or integrity of the course. Services may include extended test time, note-takers, advocacy, etc. Information about services, academic modifications or documentation requirements can be obtained from the Chapman website under “Student Services” or from Disability Services at (714) 516-4520. For more detailed information, see the Disability Services and/or the non-discrimination policy in the general information section of this catalog.
Chapman University is committed to making its educational opportunities accessible to qualified individuals with disabilities in accordance with applicable state and federal laws. By providing access to qualified students with disabilities, the University demonstrates its belief that the community will benefit from their skills and talents. In this regard, Chapman University has implemented the following policies:

Chapman University strictly prohibits any form of discrimination on the basis of an individual’s disability.
Chapman University offers reasonable accommodations to otherwise qualified individuals.

The director of Disability Services administers these policies. Summaries and references to these policies are provided in the University’s application and admissions materials and its student handbook. Individuals can also obtain information about these policies, services, documentation requirements, etc. from Disability Services at (714) 516-4520.
Disability Services serves as the clearing house for all requested accommodations. It is the responsibility of the student requesting accommodations to make these needs known in a timely fashion and to provide proper documentation and medical evaluations as required to the Office of Disabilities Services. It is recommended that the student provide these materials prior to the beginning of the academic year or term so that the University may better serve the student’s needs and the student may avoid any irreversible academic consequences. Once notification has been made the University will engage in an interactive process in order to identify our obligation to provide reasonable accommodations. Services provided will be based on the individual needs of the student and may include extended test time, notetakers, etc. The granting of any accommodation will not be retroactive and cannot jeopardize the academic standards or integrity of the course.
Library Services
The Leatherby Libraries, located on the Orange Campus, opened Fall 2004. The five-story facility serves as an intellectual and cultural heart of the campus and is designed to meet the information needs of Chapman’s students, faculty, and staff.
Our innovative libraries combine the latest information technology with the personalized attention that is the hallmark of a Chapman education. It includes nine individually named libraries with distinctive collections representing disciplinary areas of the University: arts and humanities, social sciences, science and technology, education, music, film/television/media arts, and business and economics. In addition, two special libraries are located on the 4th floor and are named the Frank Mt. Pleasant Library of Special Collections and Archives and the Sala and Aron Samueli Holocaust Memorial Library. Two additional primary archives collections are located on the lower level of the library and include the Center for American War Letters Archives and California’s Gold Exhibit and Huell Howser Archives.
The facility features fifteen group study rooms, six multi-media preview rooms, one multi-station music listening area, 97 computers for user access, wireless Internet access available throughout the building, five computer classrooms, a dedicated library instruction room, an extended-hour study commons and more than 775 seats at tables, carrels, and lounge chairs.
The Leatherby Libraries’ collection contains approximately 413,000 titles including DVDs, videos, CDs and other media; 70 print journal titles; access to over 85,000 full-text electronic journals; 307 online databases; and 18,000 electronic books that support the research and curricular needs of the campus community.
Interlibrary loan services are available to support the research needs of students and faculty by obtaining books and articles not held at Leatherby Libraries. Requests for materials from other libraries are easily submitted through Tipasa, an online system that allows individuals to set up personalized accounts, submit their own requests, and track outstanding requests.
The library information literacy and instruction program is an important part of graduate and undergraduate programs, ensuring that students are connected to the information resources they need to succeed in their courses and become life-long learners.
Additionally, the library offers a range of lectures, exhibitions, permanent art, and curriculum-related displays throughout the year. For more information, visit the Leatherby Libraries webpage.
Operation Safe Ride-Orange Campus

This service is provided to escort students, faculty, staff and visitors around Chapman University during the hours in which safety is of utmost concern (see hours of operation). Public Safety Officers can also provide an escort anytime outside the operation hours if requested by someone who feels the need for a safe escort. The service is offered free of charge and provides a designated person who will pick up a student, faculty member, staff member and/or visitor to the Campus, and deliver that person to their vehicle, room in the resident halls, or location within the designated boundaries. If you need a safe ride, call (714) 997-6680.
Public Safety
The primary role of the Office of Public Safety is to provide a safe working and learning environment for students, faculty and staff. The office operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week and provides a variety of services: safety and emergency preparedness consultation, lost and found, operation safe-ride, property identification, vehicle registration and bicycle registration.

Reserve Officer Training Corps, Air Force and Army
Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps (AFROTC)
AFROTC is a nationwide program that allows students to pursue commissions (become officers) in the United States Air Force (USAF) while simultaneously attending college. AFROTC classes are held on college campuses throughout the United States and Puerto Rico; students can register through normal course registration processes. AFROTC consists of four years of Aerospace Studies classes (Foundations of the USAF, Evolution of USAF and Space Power, Air Force Leadership Studies, and National Security Affairs/Preparation for Active Duty), and a corresponding Leadership Laboratory for each year (where students apply leadership skills, demonstrate command and effective communication, develop physical fitness, and practice military customs and courtesies). College students enrolled in the AFROTC program (known as “cadets”) who successfully complete both AFROTC training and college degree requirements will graduate and simultaneously commission as Second Lieutenants in the Active Duty Air Force. The AFROTC program is currently offered at California State University, San Bernardino, but they have a crosstown agreement that allows our students to enroll in AFROTC and become full-fledged cadet participants. For more information on the AFROTC program, please review the California State University San Bernardino’s Air Force ROTC webpage, and for information about the AFROTC courses visit the Aerospace Studies AFROTC Program Course Breakdown and LLabs webpage.
Through arrangements with California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB), and the University of Southern California (USC), students may participate in the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) Program. Aerospace studies classes and leadership laboratories are conducted at various times during the week on the main campuses of CSUSB and USC.
AFROTC offers a variety of two-, three- and four-year scholarships, many of which pay the full cost of tuition, books and fees. Successful completion of as little as six (three years) semesters of AFROTC academic classes and leadership laboratories can lead to a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force.
Classes consist of one hour of academics and two hours of laboratory for first-year students and sophomores and three hours of academics and two hours of laboratory for juniors and seniors. All cadets must participate in two one-hour sessions of physical training. All curriculum is taught on Fridays. AFROTC cadets under scholarship and all juniors and seniors receive a monthly tax-free stipend and a textbook allowance. No military commitment is incurred until entering the last two years of the program (Professional Officer Course) or accepting an AFROTC scholarship.
