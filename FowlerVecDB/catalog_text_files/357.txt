Dear Graduate Student:
Congratulations, and welcome to Chapman University! You are now a member of a wonderful family of scholars eager to provide the guidance and resources you need to succeed on the journey ahead. Every experience can provide a pathway for learning.
Regardless of difficult circumstances, Chapman faculty members are committed to the perpetual improvement of our teaching and the enrichment of our students’ learning. How we adapt to meet the pressing challenges of our time is an important measure of our success as educators and learners.
When faced with a pandemic’s adversity, our faculty discovered new ways to create and improve learning resources and access. For this reason, we have been devoting significant resources to help faculty take the lessons of the pandemic as a stimulus for further enriching the return to face-to-face experiences. The collective experience has underscored the value of faculty presence in the classroom, and the importance of education.
This catalog of courses is a guide to help you develop your own creative and adaptive paths to knowledge at Chapman. Don’t hesitate to take classes that offer something new, different, or unfamiliar to your perceived journey. Accepting the challenge of meeting new concepts is the essence of learning.
At Chapman, we want to prepare you not just to earn a living but to achieve the many rewards of a well-rounded life.
On behalf of the entire Chapman University faculty, please accept our best wishes. Let the journey begin.

Daniele C. Struppa
President
