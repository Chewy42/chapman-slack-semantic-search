The undergraduate programs are housed in the Sodaro-Pankey Undergraduate School of Media Arts within the Lawrence and Kristina Dodge College of Film and Media Arts. The Sodaro-Pankey Undergraduate School of Media Arts invites students to engage in the study and practice of self-expression through the media arts.
Acceptance into Dodge College programs is by application only. Students wishing to apply should contact Dodge College for supplemental application requirements and materials.
Students wishing to change their major, add a second major or add a minor within Dodge College should submit a Change of Major/Minor Application. Instructions for submitting a Change of Major/Minor Application can be found on the Dodge College current students website.
All entering students enroll in FTV 130 - Introduction to Visual Storytelling  during their first year. This course is an intense, hands-on production course in which students work with exploratory exercises, in assignments crafted to encourage risk-taking and creativity. This class is the gateway experience for every Dodge College student.
From there, the curriculum continues to encourage creative and intellectual exploration throughout the undergraduate course of study. In every semester students are expected to develop both fluency in expression through the media arts (through courses in the major) and an understanding of the broader cultural context in which they participate (through courses in general education).
As students proceed into upper-division courses, the degree paths become more distinct. More emphasis is put on the “business of the business,” whether the business is the film industry, film scholarship, public relations, advertising, television writing, television production, broadcast journalism or documentary filmmaking.
Each of the school’s nine bachelor degrees ends with a specific “capstone” project, to prepare the student with a calling card intended to lead them to meaningful, satisfying work after graduation.
Students pursuing a B.A. or B.F.A. in the Sodaro-Pankey Undergraduate School of Media Arts must maintain at least a 2.000 GPA in the major. All courses required for the major must be taken for a letter grade (except for independent internships) and passed with a “C-” or higher.
Students pursuing majors in animation and visual effects, broadcast journalism and documentary, public relations and advertising, and television writing and production may only use up to 3 credits of internship coursework to satisfy elective requirements within their majors. All other majors in the Sodaro-Pankey Undergraduate School of Media Arts may only use up to 6 credits of internship coursework to satisfy elective requirements within their majors.
Class Fees: Technology Fee and Insurance
Some courses in the Dodge College of Film and Media Arts carry a technology fee, which ranges from $75 to $1,000. Money collected through these fees supports the college’s special events and week-night screenings, the equipment necessary for creating film and video productions, the computer labs and software and the production environment generally.
Students in very advanced production courses will also be billed to defray the cost of insurance for equipment, personnel and locations. Details are available in the production handbook.
Minors in Dodge College of Film and Media Arts
All minors in film and media arts require an application to and approval by Dodge College for admission.
