Center for Global Education
Study Abroad
Chapman encourages students to participate in a semester or academic year abroad by offering courses and programs in all majors in almost every part of the world. Studying overseas provides a unique opportunity for fresh perspectives on international politics, economic and social issues, interpersonal relationships and ultimate career choices. All regularly enrolled Chapman students with a minimum 3.000 GPA and at least a sophomore standing are eligible to participate. Many programs offered require no previous foreign language study, although students can study the local language at most of our locations. Students studying abroad through Chapman-approved programs are enrolled in a full course of study at the host institution and receive Chapman credit. Students are often pleasantly surprised to learn that the cost for studying abroad is comparable to the current cost of studying at Chapman. Most financial aid can apply depending on the program selected, and the Center for Global Education has numerous resources for scholarships and financial aid possibilities. The semester and academic year programs directly support Chapman’s emphasis on encouraging students to recognize and develop their roles as global citizens in an increasingly interdependent world. When enrolled full-time, students who complete a semester or more abroad also automatically satisfy the Global Study portion of the General Education program. Courses taken abroad can satisfy major, minor or applicable General Education area requirements.
Exchange Programs
University-wide and major-specific exchange programs bring international students to Chapman and allow Chapman students to fully integrate in a foreign university for a semester or academic year. Many universities have courses taught in English. There are opportunities for students to immerse themselves in language and culture programs. All regularly enrolled Chapman students with a minimum 3.000 GPA are eligible to apply. Typically, a student must have a junior standing to participate, although some programs welcome sophomores. Students studying abroad through Chapman-approved programs are enrolled in a full course of study at the host institution and receive Chapman credit.
Travel Courses
Chapman faculty representing a wide range of academic departments lead domestic and international Travel Courses during the January interterm or summer session(s). Course range from one to four weeks and include either domestic or international travel components. All students are encouraged to participate in these courses in order to gain a broader perspective of other regions, countries and cultures. Participation in any Travel Course is authorized by the faculty group leader. Credit is awarded for the academic work involved in each program and may apply towards the Global Study portion of the general education requirements. Students may be eligible for a tuition waiver for their participation in a travel program.
International Internships
International Internships promote a rich cultural immersion and advance a student’s practical work experience, communication skills, leadership and teamwork. Internships help students prepare for a diverse and developing global industry. All programs are open to juniors and seniors in any major with a 3.000 or higher GPA. Students intern eight weeks and earn three credits, which can count towards the Global Study portion of the general education requirements. Students may be eligible for a tuition waiver for their participation in a Chapman Summer International Internship.
For more information on all of these Center for Global Education opportunities visit the Center for Global Education website.

Disability Services
Students with disabilities may register with the University’s Disability Services office for accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. It is the responsibility of the student requesting accommodations to make these needs known in a timely fashion and to provide proper documentation and evaluations as required. The granting of any accommodation will not be retroactive and cannot jeopardize the academic standards or integrity of the course. Services may include extended test time, note-takers, advocacy, etc. Information about services, academic modifications or documentation requirements can be obtained from the Disability Services website or from Disability Services at (714) 516-4520. For more information, also see the Disability Services and/or the Non-Discrimination Policy   section of this catalog.
Chapman University is committed to making its educational opportunities accessible to qualified individuals with disabilities in accordance with applicable state and federal laws. By providing access to qualified students with disabilities, the University demonstrates its belief that the community will benefit from their skills and talents. In this regard, Chapman University has implemented the following policies:

Chapman University strictly prohibits any form of discrimination on the basis of an individual’s disability.
Chapman University offers reasonable accommodations to otherwise qualified individuals.

The director of Disability Services administers these policies. Summaries and references to these policies are provided in the University’s application and admissions materials and its student handbook. Individuals can also obtain information about these policies, services, documentation requirements, etc. from Disability Services at (714) 516-4520.
Disability Services serves as the clearing house for all requested accommodations. It is the responsibility of the student requesting accommodations to make these needs known in a timely fashion and to provide proper documentation and medical evaluations as required to the Office of Disabilities Services. It is recommended that the student provide these materials prior to the beginning of the academic year or term so that the University may better serve the student’s needs and the student may avoid any irreversible academic consequences. Once notification has been made the University will engage in an interactive process in order to identify its obligation to provide reasonable accommodations. Services provided will be based on the individual needs of the student and may include extended test time, notetakers, etc. The granting of any accommodation will not be retroactive and cannot jeopardize the academic standards or integrity of the course.
Library Services

It includes nine individually named libraries with distinctive collections representing the University’s disciplinary areas: arts and humanities, social sciences, science and technology, education, music, film/television/media arts, and business and economics.

Requests for materials from other libraries are easily submitted through Tipasa, an online system that allows individuals to set up personalized accounts, submit their requests, and track outstanding requests.
The library information literacy and instruction program are important for graduate and undergraduate programs. It ensures that students are connected to the information resources they need to succeed in their courses and become life-long learners.

Veterans Resource Center

A benefit appointment in person or virtually can be made throught the Veterans Resource Center’s website. All eligibility for VA benefits remains under the jurisdiction of the VA and not the School Certifying Official (SCO). The SCO abides by the School Certifying Official Handbook for all policies and procedures of students using the GI Bill® serves as the liaison between the student and the Department of Veterans Affairs.
The Director of the VRC is the primary advocate for the following student populations: military-connected [active duty, reserve, national guard and their dependents (spouses and children)], using the GI Bill®, and ROTC. Please notify the VRC if a parent/guardian or spouse has served or is currently serving in the United States Armed Forces as there may be educational benefits available to the student based on that status. Our mission is to assist the military-connected student by providing timely information, resources, and comprehensive programs that increase student academic success and completion of their academic goals. 
The VRC office is open from 8am - 5pm (Monday-Friday). It is highly recommended that students utilizing VA educational benefits meet with the Director of the VRC during the semester to go over their remaining entitlement and their student account.

Veterans Benefits
Chapman University has been approved to train veterans receiving benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs in accordance with U.S. Code Title 38. Eligible veterans and their dependents seeking educational training may qualify to use Title 38, GI Bill® chapters 1606/1607, 30, 31 VR&E, 33 Post 9/11, 35 (to include Fry Scholarship). Refer to the Department of Veteran Affairs for eligibility criteria. GI Bill® is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Information for applying and using these benefits may be obtained by contacting the Veterans Resource Center. 
Only programs approved by the VA and listed on WEAMS are accepted by the GI Bill®.  Go to https://inquiry.vba.va.gov/weamspub/, click on “California” and search for Chapman University. Click on “Programs” and all degree programs will be listed under Institutions of Higher Learning, while all credentials will be listed under Non-College Degree. 
Ch 31 Vocational Readiness & Employment (VR&E)
The Director of the Veterans Resource Center sends information for all Ch 31 VR&E students to the Chapman University Campus Stores. They are provided with the student ID, name, VA counselor, and campus email address of eligible students. They will be invoicing the VA for the student’s books and supplies. To purchase these, the student needs to physically go to the Bookstore and/or Gift Shop (for additional supplies only). When checking out, the student needs to let the cashier know that they are a Ch 31 VR&E Veteran, will be charging books/supplies directly to the VA, and provide the bookstore staff with a form of identification. A personal form of payment should not be made unless the student exceeds the allotted funds. Do not place any orders online - the Campus Stores will assist students with any special order inquiries. Questions for the Bookstore or Gift Shop can be made by calling (714) 997-6718.
Institutional Aid
It is highly recommended that students work with the VRC and Financial Aid to maximize their financial aid eligibility.
Merit-based scholarships are restricted to tuition, and by law, the VA is the last payer, so merit-based scholarships are applied first. 
Chapman University offers unlimited Yellow Ribbon Scholarships at an unlimited dollar amount for those that are eligible under the Chapter 33 Post 9/11 GI Bill® at the 100% rate with entitlement. Students do not need to apply for this benefit. A video on how this benefit works is available on the Veterans Resource Center’s Financial Benefits webpage. 
Federal Aid Eligibility
Students should complete the FAFSA to be considered for Federal Aid including loans and work study.
Study Abroad Programs
Students need to contact the VRC office if they are using the Ch 33 Post 9/11 or Ch 31 VR&E and want to study abroad. 
VA Work Study
This program provides a work-study job to students using the GI Bill® that are enrolled at least 3⁄4 time.  University students can work up to 25 hours per week in the VRC serving the military-connected community. Applications can be sent to the Director of the VRC, who is also the Work Site supervisor. The VA pays the student’s stipend at either the California or Federal minimum wage (whichever is highest). More information can be found on the VRC website. 
Veterans Clubs
The Veterans Clubs are headquartered in the VRC. The Student Veterans of America (Chapman Chapter), is open to all veterans, dependents, and anyone who wishes to be a part of the veteran community. This club is a way to stay connected and involved with Chapman and other veterans/dependents who attend Chapman. The Veterans Business Association is open to all veterans, dependents, and anyone who wishes to learn more about business, accounting and economics.  
Veteran and Dependent Responsibilities

The VRC cannot certify classes that are not listed on a student’s program evaluation on record with the Registrar. Changes of major/minor/themed inquiry/emphasis must be officially completed with the Registrar before classes can be certified. 
Students using Ch 31 and Ch 33 can only have mandatory fees certified to the VA. 
Before dropping or withdrawing from a class, please contact the VRC, so that the staff can explain how VA benefits may be impacted (to include stipends, BAH/MHA, tuition/fees). Reduction of units below full time, including withdrawal from Chapman, the VA will be notified, and VA educational benefits will be prorated or discontinued. 
If a student ceases progress, either attending classes in person, online or not logging into Canvas, the VA will be notified with the effective date of last attending classes and/or logging into Canvas. VA educational benefits (tuition/fees, BAH/MHA, book stipend) will be discontinued when the veteran or eligible person ceases to make satisfactory progress. 
Please notify the VRC immediately if called or will be called to active duty.  
Meet with Academic Advising each semester to go over the student’s program evaluation.

Any charges not covered by the Chapter 33 Post 9/11 or Ch 31 VR&E, will be the responsibility of the student and are due according to the published University due dates found on the Tuition Payment Options webpage. To make payment, the student may use financial aid, pay in full online or opt into the University Payment Plan. Students utilizing a Chapman room and/or board plan: must make a payment or set up payment arrangements through the Student Business Services (SBS). Failure to do this may result in a late fee, since the monthly BAH/MHA payments go directly to the student.
Student Employment
On-campus student employment includes graduate and undergraduate hourly assignments. On-campus student employment provides an important financial resource to assist matriculated students in earning funds to offset the cost of a university education while also providing a valuable work experience. Diverse student work opportunities are available in the areas of academic, departmental or programming support, research, information systems and technology, library, athletics and tutoring to name a few. Student assignments are incidental to the student’s course of study with reasonable limitations placed during the academic semester on the nature of the work assignments and the number of hours of employment. All student workers must abide by the rules and policies listed in the student employment handbook and must meet the minimum requirements to be eligible for an on-campus student position.
On-campus recruitment continues throughout the year and is based on the business needs of the department, school, college, or campus partner participating in Chapman’s Federal Work Study program. For a list of current or upcoming positions, visit the Chapman on-campus jobs website.
If you would like to set an appointment with a representative from Student Employment in Human Resources to complete your I-9 prior to employment, you can use the HR Student Employment calendar to set a live, virtual meeting.
Student Employment is housed within the Office of Human Resources and oversees the hiring of on-campus student employees and off-campus community service tutors. For information related to the services Student Employment offers, please contact Human Resources at 714-997-6686 or to access the Student Employment Services webpage.
