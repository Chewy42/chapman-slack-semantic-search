Non-Discrimination
Chapman University is committed to creating and maintaining a community where all individuals who participate in University programs and activities can achieve their academic and professional aspirations free from harassment and discrimination. In furtherance of this commitment the University’s administration, faculty, staff, and students are each responsible for creating and maintaining an environment conducive to work, study, and learning and for cooperating with University Officials who investigate allegations of policy violations. Harassment and discrimination, in any form prohibited by this policy, impedes upon the realization of the University’s mission to provide an education of distinction in a dignified and respectful learning environment.
When the University becomes aware that a member of the University community may have been subjected to discrimination and/or harassment based upon their protected class, the University will take prompt action reasonably intended to stop any form of harassment, discrimination, and/or related retaliation, eliminate any hostile environment, prevent its recurrence, and as appropriate remedy its effects.
Chapman also affirms its deep commitment to enriching diversity and inclusion through on-going efforts to cultivate a welcoming campus climate for all members of the Chapman community. We strive to provide inclusive academic curricula, promote equity and access in recruitment and retention, and develop meaningful outreach programs and partnerships with diverse local communities. We value diversity and inclusion in the learning environment and believe it vital to the fulfillment of the University mission. It is our conviction that an inclusive learning environment facilitates complex, critical, and creative thinking and that differences in identities, values, beliefs, and perspectives are fundamental to a comprehensive education.
Chapman University prohibits any form of harassment, discrimination, and/or related retaliation in admissions and access to, and treatment in University employment, educational programs, and activities, based upon an individual’s race, color, religion, sex, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, age, marital status, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, military or veteran status, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by applicable state or federal law, so that all members of the community are treated at all times with dignity and respect. Accordingly, such discrimination or harassment is prohibited and violates University policy and will not be tolerated. Furthermore, any form of retaliation against anyone who in good faith brings a charge of harassment or discrimination, supports an individual bringing a complaint, otherwise reports harassment or discrimination, or participates in an investigation under this policy is prohibited by University policy and state and federal law. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) prohibits gender or sex-based discrimination in educational programs operated by institutions that receive federal financial assistance. Examples of programs and activities which may be included are: admissions, recruitment, financial aid, academic programs, athletics, housing, extra-curricular programs, and employment.
Chapman University prohibits gender and/or sex-based discrimination. Sexual harassment of students is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX and includes acts of sexual violence and misconduct. All students, regardless of gender, are protected from sexual harassment and/or violence in all educational programs and activities operated by Chapman University. More in-depth information regarding reporting on-campus and off-campus resources, and complaint processes and procedures may be found on the Chapman’s Title IX website at www.chapman.edu/students/health-and-safety/title-ix/.
Students who believe that they may have been discriminated against based on their sex or gender or have been subjected to sexual harassment and/or violence should consult one of the University’s Title IX Coordinators or Investigators.
The Title IX Coordinators are responsible for coordinating the University’s compliance with and responsibilities under Title IX. Major duties include, but are not limited to:

Being available to meet with students who believe sexual harassment, violence, or discrimination has occurred.
Ensuring that complaints are handled in accordance with established practices and standards.
Personally investigating the incident or overseeing the investigation.

Students who believe that they have been or are the victims of sexual harassment, including sexual assault, sexual violence, or other sexual misconduct by another University student should freely, and without fear of retaliation, report such misconduct or file a complaint with:

Title IX prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with a disability. As such, Chapman recognizes that qualified students with documented disabilities, such as mobility, sensory, health, psychological, and learning disorders may need reasonable accommodations to enable successful completion of academic coursework. Chapman will engage with the student in an interactive process to determine reasonable accommodations that may be provided to the extent that they do not compromise the integrity of any degree or certificate, do not fundamentally alter the nature of a program, or do not place an undue hardship upon the institution. Students needing assistance should contact Disability Services:

Annual Security Report
Chapman University’s annual security and fire safety report includes statistics for the previous three years concerning reported crimes that occurred on campus, in certain off-campus buildings owned or controlled by Chapman University and on public property within or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus. The report also includes institutional policies concerning campus security, such as policies concerning alcohol and drug use, crime prevention, the reporting of crimes, sexual assault, and other matters. A copy of the Annual Security Report may be viewed on Chapman University’s Office of Public Safety webpage at www.chapman.edu/campus-services/public-safety.
Daily Crime & Fire Log
Public Safety maintains a daily crime and fire log. The crime log describes the nature of the crime, date the crime was reported, date and time the crime occurred, general location of the crime and disposition of the complaint, if known. The fire log reflects on-campus residential fires reported to Public Safety. To view the daily log visit www.chapman.edu/campus-services/public-safety/crime-log.
