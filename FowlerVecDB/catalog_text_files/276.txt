In addition to traditional residence halls, Chapman University housing also offers several apartment communities for students.
Housing for First Year Students

Orientation
New student orientation provides programming that welcomes and facilitates the smooth transition of incoming students and their families to the campus community.

Families gain important insight into the values, traditions, and resources of Chapman that will equip them to become better partners in the educational journey of their students.
Orientation activities also expose students to academics, student services, and co-curricular activities at Chapman. Through these activities, students and their families interact with Chapman faculty, staff, administrators, and other students, facilitating greater connections between the students and their new community.

The Student Government Association has worked tirelessly for improvements on campus, including the smoke-free campus initiative, a week-long Thanksgiving break, sustainable initiatives, Laptops-to-Go, student organization support, and more. SGA also represents the student voice in a multitude of ways. Senators regularly serve on campus committees to involve students in decision-making that directly affects the student body, as well as by making it easy and accessible to reach out to your elected representatives on campus, online, or over the phone.
All undergraduate students are members of and support the SGA through the Associated Student fee, a large portion of which is allocated by the SGA back to students for conferences and student organization events. All students also receive a copy of the yearbook, voting privileges in SGA elections, and the eligibility to hold positions if they meet position requirements per the SGA governing documents. To find out more information about SGA, including how to get involved, visit www.chapman.edu/SGA.
PEER and Health Education
PEER stands for Proactive Education Encouraging Responsibility. This department provides students with information regarding alcohol and substance abuse, sexual assault prevention, communication and life skills, conflict resolution, STD prevention (including HIV/AIDS), stress reduction and other related mental, physical and social health issues. It also provides programming opportunities for students in many of these areas. This department is responsible for the educational component of the Healthy Panther Initiative.
Chapman’s PEER and Health Education department also provides students with opportunities to explore how high risk choices can impact a person’s likelihood to achieve career and life goals. Wise decision-making, responsibility and awareness of consequences are key components of the many programs that this office sponsors. Students are also encouraged to receive training to provide services to fellow students in the area of rape and sexual assault prevention education. For more information, please call (714) 744-7080 or stop by room 303F in Argyros Forum.
Public Safety
The primary role of the Office of Public Safety is to provide a safe working and learning environment for students, faculty and staff. The office operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week and provides a variety of services: safety and emergency preparedness consultation, lost and found, operation safe-ride, property identification, vehicle registration and bicycle registration. The Office of Public Safety requires that all vehicles and bicycles on campus be registered and all registrations are processed through this office. For more information about parking and registering your vehicle you can log onto the following website: www.chapman.edu/campus-services/parking-services/register.aspx. The Office of Public Safety is located at 418 North Glassell.
Student Health Services
Physical well-being has a tremendous impact on academic performance. The goal of medical services is to provide the opportunity for academic success, while the focus is to provide students with easy access to health care and disease prevention.
Chapman University Student Health (CUSH) is staffed with nurse practitioners, nurses and physicians to promote good health and to assess and treat a variety of physical ailments that typically affect college-age students. Services include first aid treatment and triage, primary medicine, gynecological services, immunizations and health screening. Some medications are provided for a modest fee and some prescriptions are called into the students’ pharmacy of choice. When a student’s condition is beyond the scope of CUSH, the student may be referred off-campus for health care to a physician or clinic in the community.
The Chapman Student Health Center is located at 402 North Glassell Street (corner of Glassell and Sycamore), Orange, CA 92866. The phone number for the health center is (714) 997-6851. The center is available for walk-in visits Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to noon during regular terms. It is recommended that appointments be made for afternoon hours.
Student Psychological Counseling Services
A range of confidential, short-term psychological counseling services is provided to students on an as-available basis. Limited psychiatric evaluations are available to students who are seen at SPCS for therapy. Referrals to other off-campus psychiatrists and therapists are available for all students. All full-time undergraduates are eligible for services; part-time and graduate students on the Orange Campus must opt to pay a health and counseling fee at the time of registration.

Student Affairs Policies
Student Conduct Code
Chapman University expects that all students adhere to the policies that govern student behavior outlined in the Student Conduct Code. The University is specifically concerned when individual student and organizational behavior directly interfere with the University’s primary educational objectives and functions or the rights and safety of others. Chapman believes that the conduct process has a role in developing a sense of responsibility and accountability in students, while being life preparatory. To that end, the University uses education and counseling, in addition to formal conduct proceedings to bring about these outcomes. Every Chapman student is presumed to have sufficient maturity, intelligence and concern for the rights of others and the rights of the institution to help maintain established standards of the academic community. When a student or organization’s behavior demonstrates otherwise, the University will consider conduct proceedings as deemed necessary. For details regarding institutional policies governing student conduct or the disciplinary process, see the Chapman University Student Conduct Code or visit the Dean of Students Web page. Refer to the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students website at www.chapman.edu/students/dean-of-students/ to find the Code, required notifications and other relevant policies.
Healthy Panther
Chapman’s Healthy Panther Initiative (HPI) embodies the philosophy that learning to make healthy decisions is not only an important part of college education, it is essential to achieving personal and academic aspirations. The definition of a Healthy Panther includes:

A student who consistently respects her or his community and others.
A student who, if sexually active, consistently practices safer sex.
A student who is knowledgeable about alcohol and other drugs and their effects on the body and decisions.
A student who develops a healthy plan for herself or himself and sticks with it.
A student who drinks in moderation or not at all.

The Healthy Panther Initiative provides students with learning beyond formal education, knowledge about alcohol and other drugs and their effects on the body. The program’s goal is to provide essential information that will educate students about the effects of alcohol on the individual and how it can affect not only the individual, but also the individual’s societal surroundings; thus, empowering the individual to expand their coping skills regarding healthy relationships and decision making, enabling them to take control of their life choices and make positive decisions. Healthy Panther Initiative also educates students regarding affirmative consent, active bystander intervention skills, and related sexual violence prevention issues. Research has shown that combining motivational interviewing with an online feedback system can help students reduce risky behaviors. The HPI has two distinct components that must be completed by all new undergraduate students:
Part 1: The first part of Healthy Panther initiative involves an interactive group presentation focusing on high risk behaviors during which all new undergraduate students will be introduced to or reminded of, the potential consequences of these behaviors, including alcohol poisoning, rape and sexual assault and the spread of HIV and other STDs. The session lasts approximately 75 minutes and attempts to enhance student coping skills; thus, empowering students to take control of their lives and choices, while introducing them to services provided here at Chapman.
Part 2: The second component is the completion of a follow-up survey. Approximately six weeks following the presentation, students will receive a follow-up survey through their Chapman email account from SurveyMonkey. Once the student completes the 30 minute survey they will have completed the Healthy Panther Initiative.
Chapman University students and their guests are expected to abide by all federal, state and local laws, as well as Chapman policies governing the use of alcohol and drugs. This requires that students and their guests not only have knowledge of these various laws and policies, but also are responsible and mature decision makers. Chapman University seeks to impart this knowledge and these values first and foremost through educational means relying heavily on positive staff and faculty role modeling, the formation and use of a peer education network and curriculum infusion whenever possible. Factual information and knowledge regarding alcohol and drugs, skills and strategies for achieving and maintaining healthy behaviors, creation of a cooperative and consistent campus peer environment and compliance with all local and federal regulations are components of this educational agenda. Illegal and abusive use of alcohol and other drugs by any member of the campus community constitutes an untenable threat to the community and signals a need for intervention on the part of the University. All campus event use of alcohol must be approved via an alcohol use permit. For further details, refer to the Chapman University Alcohol and Substance Abuse Policy or visit the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students website at www.chapman.edu/studentaffairs/dean.
Financial Responsibility
It is expected that students shall be responsible for their financial obligations, both to the University and to the larger community. Students who do not meet their financial obligations may be prevented from further enrollment at Chapman and may be subject to conduct review.
Firearms and Fireworks
The possession or use of firearms, fireworks or other explosives is prohibited on campus and may be grounds for immediate dismissal.
Freedom of Speech and Expression
Freedom of speech and expression are especially important values within an academic community. Thus, with rare exception, all topics are appropriate for discussion and debate within the framework of academic inquiry. Students and student organizations are free to examine and discuss all questions of interest to them and to express opinions publicly and privately. Students are always free to support causes by orderly means, which do not disrupt the regular and essential operation of the institution. At the same time, it is clear to the academic and the larger community that in their public expressions or demonstrations, students or student organizations speak only for themselves and not for the institution.
Grievance Procedures
Students who have concerns about campus academic policies, procedures, other policies, treatment by faculty or other campus employees or concerns about college operations are encouraged to bring those concerns or complaints to the attention of the appropriate campus personnel.
For academic matters, the process normally begins with the faculty member involved. Appeals typically go to the department chair, the academic dean, the Undergraduate Academic Council, and then the vice provost for undergraduate education. For non-academic matters (issues related to departments such as residence life, facilities management, business office, etc.), students should first discuss the matter with the head of the appropriate department with appeals to the appropriate supervisor. Students unsure of whom to contact should consult with the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students for appropriate referral.
Harassment, Discrimination and Sexual Harassment
Chapman University is committed to providing an environment which is free from any form of harassment and discrimination based upon an individual’s race, color, religion, sex, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, age, marital status, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, military or veteran status, genetic information or any other characteristic protected by applicable state or federal law, so that all members of the community are treated at all times with dignity and respect. The University is also committed to providing an environment which is free of sexual harassment in any form. It is the University’s policy, therefore, to prohibit all forms of such harassment or discrimination among University faculty, students, staff, and administrators. Independent contractors and other third parties at the University are also expected to conform their conduct to the University’s Harassment, Discrimination and Sexual Harassment Policy. The University’s ability to take action against third parties may be limited and is determined by their context of the prohibited conduct and the nature of the relationship to the parties and the University.
View a copy of the entire policy at www.chapman.edu/faculty-staff/human-resources/_files/harassment-and-discrimination-policy.pdf
The University’s administrative, faculty, staff and students are each responsible for creating and maintaining an environment conducive to work, study, and learning and for cooperating with University officials who investigate allegations of policy violations. It is the duty of every member of the faculty, staff, and administrative to assure compliance with the policy by promptly reporting allegations of the policy violations to the University’s Equal Opportunity and Diversity Officer. Students are also strongly encouraged to report any alleged violations of this policy, and may do so by reporting the Equal Opportunity and Diversity Officer.
In keeping with its policies, Chapman University not only fully complies with all local, state, and federal laws concerning harassment and discrimination, but also provided a means to assure fair treatment to any student, employee or member of the University community who believes the policy prohibiting harassment, discrimination, and sexual harassment has been violated. For further information, concerning Chapman University’s Harassment, Discrimination and Sexual Harassment Policy, please contact the University’s Equal Opportunity and Diversity Officer at (714) 997-6847.
Hazing and Disorderly Conduct
Hazing, indecent or disorderly conduct or failure to comply with the directions of Chapman officials acting in the regular performance of their duties are not compatible with the University’s function as an educational institution and is forbidden by the Student Conduct Code. Any such behavior will result in conduct proceedings and appropriate consequences.
Local, State and Federal Laws
Students attending Chapman are subject to local, state, federal laws, and when studying outside the United States laws of foreign jurisdiction(s). Chapman reserves the right to impose institutional sanctions for violations of public laws, even when such violations occur off University property. Students may also be subject to civil and/or criminal charges for offenses on Chapman property, if such offenses are in violation of local, state or federal laws, in addition to any accountability that they may face under the Student Conduct Code or other University policies.
Rights and Privacy Act/Confidentiality of Educational Records
Chapman’s policy regarding confidentiality is in keeping with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which affords students certain rights with respect to their education records, a summary of which follows:

The right to inspect and review the student’s own education records within 45 days of the day Chapman University receives a request for access.
The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes are inaccurate.
The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student’s education records.

One exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. School officials are individuals or entities working for or on the behalf of Chapman University. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill their professional responsibility.
As allowed within FERPA guidelines, Chapman University may disclose education records without consent to officials of another school, upon request, in which a student seeks or intends to enroll.

The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failure by Chapman University to comply with the requirements of FERPA.

At its discretion, Chapman University may provide public directory information in accordance with the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Directory information is defined as information that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. Students may withhold directory information by notifying the University Registrar in writing.
A complete text of Chapman’s annual notification to students of their rights under FERPA is contained on the website of the Office of the University Registrar.
Violence
Per the Student Conduct Code, any form of violence is forbidden and may result in immediate suspension from the campus and upon appropriate determination, expulsion from Chapman University.
