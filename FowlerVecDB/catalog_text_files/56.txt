The mission of Wilkinson College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences is to foster rigorous inquiry among our students through a curriculum grounded in the liberal arts that is scholarly, creative, interdisciplinary, and experiential. Wilkinson College plays an important and unique role in the educational journey of every Chapman student and aims to ensure that graduates are prepared to assume their responsibility as global citizens, acting knowledgeably, and providing compassionate leadership in our community and world.
Wilkinson College invites students to explore the liberal arts within a vibrant intellectual community where faculty and students work together to advance their respective fields of knowledge and to make a difference in the world.
Students take part in collaborative student-faculty research, internships, community service, travel courses and study abroad, student clubs and organizations, and the Engaging the World: Leading the Conversation initiative that extends learning beyond the classroom. Robust advising and support for declared and undeclared majors are provided during this exciting time of discovery.
Wilkinson College also offers ten interdisciplinary minors that draw on the expertise of faculty members from across the college and university.
